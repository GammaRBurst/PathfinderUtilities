		<h1>Feat Rules</h1>
		<p>A small consideration before listing all the various rules. You may notice some small differences between the text presented here and the one you can find in the manuals. First of all, the prerequisites have been ordered. I chose to list them always in the same order: first the minimum ability scores, then feats, race, level, mythic rank, class level, base attack bonus, caster level, skill ranks and finally anything else, such as racial or class features. Duplicate prerequisites have also been removed. For example, a feat that requires Power Attack doesn't need to list a minimum Strength score of 13, because that's already a prerequisite of Power Attack. Also, different prerequisites are now always separated by a semicolon (;), all conditions separated in this way must be fulfilled in order to qualify for the feat. Commas are used for situations where only one prerequisite has to be fulfilled (as in &quot;prerequisite one, two, or three&quot;). Finally, I decided to remove all explicit references to manuals, pages, chapters and tables that are not directly included in the text or in the following rules.</p>
		<p>Of course there is always the possibility that some mistakes passed unnoticed. In case of doubts confront the text with the one you can find on manuals and rulebooks.</p>

			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Sources</span>: <span class="under">Andoran, Spirit of Liberty</span> (2010), page 13; <span class="under">Legacy of Fire Player's Guide</span> (2009, for D&amp;D 3.5), page 29</p>
			<p>Inspired by a variety of video games and board games that utilize similar conventions, achievement feats require the cooperation of the player and the GM to make the transition into the world of pen-and-paper RPGs. Players who seek to qualify for an achievement feat should tell their GM early so he can begin noting the PC’s progress toward the feat’s requirement, or be aware that the player is tracking his character’s accomplishments with this goal in mind. Although they require more bookkeeping to attain than typical feats, these feats are custom-designed to offer Andoren characters new incentives to promote the fundamental ideals of their nation.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Editor's note</span>: Achievement feats were released very early and were since then discontinued. For this reason there are only a few and only for Andoren characters. If you are looking for similar feats, I suggest also looking into story feats.</p>

			<p>If you have at least 10 Hit Dice, you can take any alignment feat that matches your alignment. You cannot have more than one alignment feat at any time, but after changing alignment, when you reach a new character level, you can freely switch your alignment feat to your new alignment’s feat. Most alignment feats have a Residual entry that allows you to benefit from some part of the feat even when you no longer meet the alignment prerequisite for the feat, usually aiding you in a small way to regain that alignment. Most alignment feats also allow you to store affirmations for later use. If you shift alignment and no longer have the ability to store affirmations, any affirmations stored by that feat are lost.</p>

			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Armor Master's Handbook</span> (2016), page 16</p>
			<p>Armor mastery feats are a type of feat that require armor training as a prerequisite. They count as combat feats for all purposes, including which classes can select them as bonus feats. You gain the benefits of an armor mastery feat only while wearing armor with which you are proficient and only while wearing a type of armor that matches the feat’s armor proficiency feat prerequisite, if any. Armor mastery feats without armor proficiency prerequisites can be used while wearing any suit of armor. Characters who lack the armor training class feature can access armor mastery feats by taking the Armor Focus feat, presented below.</p>

			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Champions of Corruption</span> (2014), page 20</p>
			<p>&quot;Teamwork&quot; is a relative term. Many villains don’t concern themselves with collateral damage and make their plans with exceeding ruthlessness. Betrayal feats are several teamwork feats with the common theme of reaping a benefit at your allies’ expense. All of these feats refer to an initiator and an abettor. The initiator is the one activating the feat (also referred to as &quot;you&quot;) and the abettor is an ally who also has the feat and whose presence and (perhaps unwilling) sacrifice allows the feat to take effect. Choosing one of these feats effectively grants consent for an ally with the same feat to harm you in combat, and vice versa, but evil characters are often willing to take big risks to get the upper hand. Some recruit devoted minions specifically to use in this way. Characters with class abilities granting allies access to teamwork feats (such as cavaliers or inquisitors) can select these teamwork feats normally, but allies who are granted these feats can use the feats only as initiators, not as abettors. An inquisitor could not grant an ally the Ally Shield feat and then use the ally as a shield, for example, but he could allow that ally to use him as a shield.</p>

		<h3 class="show" id="show_4">Blood Hex</h3>
		<div class="content" id="4">
			<h3 class="hide" id="hide_4">Blood Hex</h3>
			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Magic Tactics Toolbox</span> (2016), page 28</p>
			<p>The spilling of blood can unleash significant magic power, and many cultures on Golarion have developed ways of accessing that power. Some among the winter witches of Irrisen and the dervishes of Casmaron can use magic powered by inflicting significant wounds to curse their enemies. More sinister versions of these hexes can be found in the shadowy realms of Nidal and among the criminal blood magicians of Tian Xia. While these disparate magical traditions employ different terms for the tactic, a curse powered by the subject’s own blood loss is commonly known as a blood hex.</p>
			<p>Blood hexes take many forms, but all obey some basic rules that apply to each blood hex feat. Blood hex feats are available to any character who meets the feat’s prerequisites. Blood hex feats work only against targets you have dealt hit point damage to recently, with the exact time frame and any requirements for how you deal the damage outlined in each feat. The saving throw DC of a blood hex is always equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). You can target a creature with the same blood hex at most once every 24 hours, whether it is affected by the blood hex or not. You can use a number of blood hexes per day equal to the number of blood hex feats you have, plus one additional use per day at 4th level and every 4 character levels thereafter. You can use the same blood hex multiple times, as long as you don’t exceed your total uses of blood hexes for the day.</p>
			<p>Shamans and witches can take a blood hex feat in place of a regular hex and sometimes gain additional effects when they use a blood hex, but must still deal hit point damage to a creature in order to use the blood hex. A shaman or witch can use blood hexes an unlimited number of times per day, but still cannot target the same creature with the same blood hex more than once every 24 hours. All blood hexes with a duration of 1 round can be extended normally using the cackle hex or the chant hex.</p>
			<p>The effects of a given blood hex doesn’t stack with themselves, even if the blood hex is used by different sources, but a creature can be cursed with any number of different blood hexes at one time. A blood hex is a supernatural curse effect, and counts as a hex for the purposes of abilities that work against hexes.</p>

		<h3 class="show" id="show_5">Called Shot</h3>
		<div class="content" id="5">
			<h3 class="hide" id="hide_5">Called Shot</h3>
			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Ultimate Combat</span> (2011), page 193</p>
			<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game deals with hits and damage in a rather abstract way, treating almost all hits the same except for the amount and type of damage dealt. With these optional called shot rules, PCs, monsters, and villains alike can aim their attacks more precisely, potentially to devastating effect.</p>
			<p>These rules are an optional addition to any campaign, and should be approached with care by the Game Master.</p>
			<h3>Making Called Shots</h3>
			<p>A called shot is an attack aimed at a particular part of the body, in the hope of gaining some extra effect from the attack. The smaller or better guarded the area, the more difficult the called shot. A called shot is a single attack made as a full-round action, and thus can’t be combined with a charge, feats like Vital Strike, or multiple attacks with a full-attack action.</p>
			<p>Called shots are divided into three basic difficulty groups: easy, tricky, and challenging. Easy called shots represent large areas of the body, and are made at a –2 penalty. They have relatively minor effects unless a critical hit is scored or massive damage is dealt. Tricky called shots represent either smaller areas, like a hand, or areas a creature protects well, like its head. Tricky shots receive a –5 penalty, and inflict more serious consequences. Challenging called shots represent very small areas like eyes, fingers, or creatures’ necks. They receive a –10 penalty, and successful hits cause significant short-term impairment. Beyond these challenging ratings lie almost impossible called shots that receive a –20 penalty. For called shots against non-humanoid creatures, use common sense and the categories above as guidelines. For example, a flying creature’s wings are treated as arms.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Range and Reach</span>: Called shots work best at close range. Melee called shots are at a –2 penalty if the target isn’t adjacent to its attacker. For called shots made at range, all range penalties due to range increment are doubled, with a minimum penalty of –2 for any called shot against a target that’s not within 30 feet.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Hits and Critical Threats</span>: A called shot has the normal chance for a critical hit, and inflicts an extra effect if one is confirmed. The exact effects of a successful critical hit depend on where the target was hit, and are described under Called Shot Effects.</p>
			<h3>Additional Rules</h3>
			<p><span class="bold">Automatic Hits</span>: Some effects in the game, like <span class="italic">true strike</span> or the flash of insight ability of cyclopes, provide automatic or nearly automatic hits. Using such an ability on a called shot turns it into a normal attack, with none of the benefits or penalties associated with called shots. From a story perspective, this is because the effect cannot distinguish between a hit in general and a hit in a particular area, but it’s also necessary to keep the power of such abilities in line with their original intended effects. Some Game Masters may prefer a more theatrical or dangerous game in which magic can make a shot through the eye nearly certain, in which case this rule can be ignored.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Cover</span>: Cover other than soft cover interferes with a called shot even more than with a normal shot. Double any AC bonuses provided by cover that isn’t soft cover. In addition, cover may make certain called shots impossible.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Concealment</span>: The miss chance for a called shot against a creature with concealment increases to 50%. It’s not possible to make a called shot against a creature with total concealment. For effects that function like concealment, such as <span class="italic">blink</span> and <span class="italic">displacement</span>, a miss chance of 50% or more prevents called shots, a miss chance of 20% increases to 50%, and miss chances of other values are doubled.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Damage Reduction</span>: If damage reduction completely negates the damage from a called shot, the called shot has no effect. If hit point damage does get through, the called shot has normal effects. Damage reduction does not reduce any ability damage, ability drain, penalties, or bleed damage caused by the called shot.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Immunity</span>: Immunity to critical hits protects against the extra effects of called shots. Partial protection, such as that provided by the <span class="italic">fortification</span> special ability of some magical armors, protects the creature as though the called shot were a critical hit.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Regeneration</span>: Regeneration provides no special protection against called shots, but it might negate or undo some of the effects, such as bleeding or limb loss.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Saving Throws</span>: If a saving throw is allowed on a called shot, the DC is equal to the Armor Class hit by the attack. In the case of an attack roll of a natural 20, the DC is the AC the attack would have hit if 20s did not automatically hit.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Stacking</span>: Unless otherwise stated, penalties for multiple called shots do not stack, even if they are to different areas of the body. Ability damage and drain caused by called shots always stacks.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Touch Attacks</span>: Touch attacks and ranged touch attacks made as called shots must target AC rather than touch AC. This represents the care it takes to target such strikes.</p>
			<h3>Called Shot Effects</h3>
			<p>The consequences of a successful called shot vary depending on whether the hit is a normal hit, a critical hit, or a debilitating blow (a hit for 50 points of damage or more). When more than one limb or organ can be affected by a called shot, the attacker can choose the target if desired; otherwise, it should be determined randomly.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: An attack aimed at a body part that deals fewer than 50 points of damage results in a normal called shot. Called shots inflict either minor penalties or temporary inconveniences.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: When a called shot is confirmed as a critical hit but deals fewer than half the creature’s hit points of damage (minimum 50), a critical called shot results. Critical called shots can cause ability damage, bleeding, and other serious effects.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A called shot that deals half the creature’s hit points of damage (minimum 50) or more (whether a critical hit or not) results in a debilitating blow that has extra effects. A debilitating blow inflicts major consequences and potentially permanent consequences.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Concentration Checks</span>: Concentration checks forced by called shots to parts of the body involved in spellcasting (generally the head for spells with verbal components, and the casting arm and hand for spells with somatic components) are made at a –5 penalty.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Healing Called Shot Effects</span>: Some called shot effects render a given location useless until healed. Remedying this condition requires the victim be healed (naturally or magically, and by one or more sources of healing) for as many hit points of damage as the called shot caused. If the victim is suffering from multiple wounds of this sort, divide healing equally between them. The <span class="italic">regenerate</span> spell repairs any and all effects of called shots except for ability damage and ability drain.</p>

			<h4>Arm</h4>
			<p>Arms are the manipulating limbs of a creature, including tentacles. Wings are also considered to be arms for purposes of a called shot. Called shots to the arm are easy (–2 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to an arm deals no additional damage, but for 1d4 rounds, any attack rolls, ability checks, or skill checks made using the wounded arm take a –2 penalty. A flying creature shot in the wing must make a Fly check to avoid descending involuntarily.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the arm deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the ability damage (minimum 1 point to each attribute). The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the arm for 1d4 minutes.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage and 1d6 points of Strength damage. The blow renders the arm useless until healed unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the arm is severed or otherwise mangled such that only <span class="italic">regeneration</span> or similar effects can repair it. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the arm (if the arm remains usable) for 2d6 minutes.</p>
			<h4>Chest</h4>
			<p>Called shots to the chest are aimed at the well-protected center of mass of a creature. Called shots to the chest are easy (–2 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the chest deals no additional damage, but any skill checks caused by the hit (such as an Acrobatics check while balancing or a Climb check while climbing) take a –2 penalty.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the chest deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage and fatigues the target. A successful Fortitude saving throw (made after the Constitution damage is applied) negates the fatigue. The creature also suffers the effects of a called shot to the chest.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the chest deals 2d4 points of Constitution damage and exhausts the target. A successful Fortitude saving throw (made after the Constitution damage is applied) reduces the exhaustion to fatigue. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature’s internal injuries deal 1 point of Constitution damage in any round the creature takes a standard action. The internal injuries can be healed by either a DC 25 Heal check or by healing as many hit points as the debilitating blow dealt, whether by magical or natural means. The creature also suffers the effects of a called shot to the chest.</p>
			<h4>Ear</h4>
			<p>Ears are the organs used to hear. Creatures without visible ears generally aren’t susceptible to called shots to that location. Called shots to the ear are challenging (–10 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the ear deafens that ear for 1 round, and imposes a –2 penalty on Perception checks. A creature that loses hearing in all ears is deafened until hearing is returned by way of the <span class="italic">remove blindness/deafness</span> spell or a similar effect.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the ear deafens that ear for 2d6 minutes and leaves the target staggered for 1 round. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the ear for that duration.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the ear destroys that ear and stuns the target for 1 round, then leaves it staggered for 1d4 rounds, and deafened until removed with the remove blindness/deafness spell or a similar effect. A successful Fortitude saving throw deafens the creature until it is restored by the <span class="italic">remove blindness/deafness</span> spell or a similar effect.</p>
			<h4>Eye</h4>
			<p>Eyes include whatever organs a creature uses to see. At the Game Master’s discretion, a called shot to the eye can also target sensory organs such as antennae, potentially negating abilities like blindsense. Generally, a creature can’t be blinded until it has lost all vision in all of its eyes. Creatures with five or more eyes take no penalties from called shots to their eyes until they’re blinded in enough eyes to bring them down a single functional eye, but can still be blinded in that eye by a critical hit or debilitating blow. Called shots to the eye are challenging (–10 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the eye gives all of the target’s foes concealment against its attacks for 1 round and gives it a –2 penalty on Perception checks. If the creature only has one functional eye prior to the called shot, it is blinded for 1 round instead.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the eye costs the target sight in that eye for 1d4 minutes. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the eye for that duration.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the eye destroys that eye, causes blindness until the condition is removed with a <span class="italic">remove blindness/deafness</span> spell or similar effect, and deals 1d6 points of bleed damage. A successful Reflex saving throw reduces this to 1d4 hours of loss of sight in that eye and eliminates the bleeding. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the eye for 2d6 minutes.</p>
			<h4>Hand</h4>
			<p>Hands include most extremities used for fine manipulation. Called shots to the hand are tricky (– 5 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: For 1d4 rounds, any attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, or skill checks made using the wounded hand take a –2 penalty, including attack and damage rolls with two-handed weapons. In addition, the target takes a –4 penalty to its CMD to resist disarm attempts, and drops its weapon (if any) on an attack roll result of a natural 1.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the hand deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. In addition, the target drops anything it is holding in that hand unless it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Items held in two hands aren’t dropped, but the target still loses its grip with the injured hand. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the hand for 1d4 minutes.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. The blow renders the hand useless until healed unless the target succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the hand is severed or otherwise mangled such that only regenerationor similar effects can repair it. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, anything held in the wounded hand is automatically dropped, even items held in two or more hands. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the hand (if the hand remains usable) for 2d6 minutes.</p>
			<h4>Head</h4>
			<p>Called shots to the head are tricky (– 5 penalty), as most creatures show some skill at dodging attacks aimed at their faces. Some creatures, such as otyughs and purple worms, lack a proper head altogether. Creatures with multiple heads must be hit by called shots to all their heads in a single round to suffer ill effects, and even then, only suffer the least effect that is inflicted on any single head (so for example, an ettin would need to take critical hits to both heads to receive the effects of a critical called shot to the head).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the head leaves the target sickened for 1d4 rounds.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the head deals 1d6 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (randomly determine which) and staggers the target for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw prevents the target from being staggered. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the head for 1d4 minutes.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the head deals 1d6 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage (roll separately for each), and knocks the target unconscious for 1d10 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw prevents the target from being knocked unconscious, but leaves it staggered for 1d10 rounds instead. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is rendered senseless by severe brain trauma (as the <span class="italic">feeblemind</span> spell) until it receives a <span class="italic">heal</span>, <span class="italic">greater restoration</span>, or similar effect. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the head for 2d6 minutes.</p>
			<h4>Heart</h4>
			<p>A called shot to the heart represents an attempt at a killing blow. If the hit isn’t either a critical hit or a debilitating blow, the attempt fails and is just a normal hit. A called shot to the heart can be used for any small, likely fatal location on a creature, such as the only weakness on an unimaginably ancient red dragon. Called shots to the heart are challenging (–10 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the heart is just a normal hit with no extra effect.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the heart pierces the organ, causing exhaustion and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to fatigue and 1 point of Constitution bleed damage. In either case, stopping the bleeding requires either <span class="italic">regeneration</span> (spell or special ability), magic healing that heals as many points of damage (from one or more sources) as the original blow dealt, or a successful DC 20 heal check that takes 1d4 rounds to complete.</p>
			<p>A critical hit to the heart against a vampire made with a piercing weapon composed entirely of wood leaves the vampire impaled through the heart by the weapon if it fails its Fortitude save, with effects as described in creature description.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the heart destroys it, instantly killing any creature that relies on its heart to survive. Creatures that succeed at a Fortitude save suffer exhaustion and take 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed damage, as do creatures that can survive without a heart.</p>
			<p>A debilitating blow to the heart against a vampire made with a piercing weapon made entirely of wood affects the vampire as a critical hit to the heart; for example, it still receives a Fortitude save to avoid the consequences.</p>
			<h4>Leg</h4>
			<p>Legs are the ambulatory limbs of a creature, including feet. Called shots to the leg have no special effect on creatures with five or more legs. Called shots to the leg are easy (–2 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to a leg lowers the target creature’s speed by 10 feet for 1d4 rounds if it has two or fewer legs, and by 5 feet if it has three or four legs. In either case, the creature’s speed cannot be reduced below 5 feet per round. Called shots to the leg have no effect on creatures with five or more legs. Hitting the same leg more than once has no extra effect, but the speed penalty for hits on different legs stack. Additionally, any skill or ability checks involving movement (such as Acrobatics or Swim checks) take a –2 penalty for 1d4 rounds.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit to the leg deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and knocks the target prone. A successful Fortitude save keeps the creature from falling prone. The creature also suffers the effects of a called shot to the leg for 1d4 minutes.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the leg knocks the creature prone. The blow renders the leg entirely useless until healed unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the leg is severed or otherwise mangled such that only <span class="italic">regeneration</span> or similar effects can repair it. If the save succeeds, the target is instead lamed and moves at half speed until the leg is healed, or until it receives a successful DC 20 Heal check. A creature with a useless or severed leg moves at half speed if it still has more than half of its legs usable; otherwise, it cannot stand up and must crawl to move. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the leg (if the leg remains usable) for 2d6 minutes.</p>
			<h4>Neck</h4>
			<p>The neck makes for a difficult but rewarding target. Injuries to the neck keep a creature from speaking easily, and if blood vessels or the windpipe are damaged, such injuries rapidly lead to death. Creatures that lack vulnerable heads generally can’t be attacked in the neck either. Called shots to the neck are challenging (–10 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the neck makes speaking above a hoarse whisper impossible for 1 round. Spells with verbal components have a 20% chance of failing outright, as do attempts to activate command-word items (although for magic items, the use of the item is not wasted).Critical Called Shot: A critical hit to the neck deals 1d6 points of bleed damage. In addition, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer a crushed windpipe and be unable to breathe or speak, possibly suffocating. A crushed windpipe can be repaired by magical healing (from one or more sources) that heals as many hit points of damage as the original hit dealt, or by a DC 25 Heal check to open up a hole into the windpipe. The latter check deals 2d6 hit points of damage, and leaves the creature still unable to speak. If target makes its saving throw, it still suffers the effects of a called shot to the neck for 1d4 minutes.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the neck leaves the target unable to speak or breathe and deals 1d4 points of Constitution bleed damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this to 2d6 points of regular (hit point) bleed damage, and the target is only unable to speak and breathe for 1d4 minutes. The Constitution bleed damage caused by a debilitating blow to the neck can only be stopped by <span class="italic">regeneration</span> (spell or special ability), magical healing (from one or more sources) that heals as many points of damage as the original blow dealt, or a DC 20 Heal check that takes 1d4 rounds to complete.</p>
			<h4>Vitals</h4>
			<p>The vitals correspond to the abdomen on a humanoid: critical organs not well-protected by bone. Attacks on the vitals can also include dastardly &quot;low blows&quot;. Vitals for non-humanoid creatures can include nearly any location that is relatively hard to hit, poorly protected, and debilitating if struck. Called shots to the vitals are tricky (– 5 penalty).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Called Shot</span>: A called shot to the vitals leaves the target sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1 round. While sickened from the blow, the target cannot run or charge.</span>
			<p><span class="bold">Critical Called Shot</span>: A critical hit deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. In addition, the target is nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d6 minutes. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the nauseated condition. While the target is sickened from the blow, it cannot run or charge.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Debilitating Blow</span>: A debilitating blow to the vitals deals 1d6 points of Constitution drain, nauseates the target for 1d4 rounds, and sickens it for 2d6 minutes. A successful Fortitude save reduces the drain to damage and the nausea to 1 round. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target is disemboweled or otherwise horrifically wounded, and takes 1 point of Constitution bleed damage. The Constitution bleed damage caused by a debilitating blow to the vitals can only be stopped by <span class="italic">regeneration</span> (spell or special ability), magical healing that heals as many points of damage (from one or more sources) as the original blow dealt, or a DC 20 Heal check that takes 1d4 rounds to complete.</p>

			<h3 class="hide" id="hide_11">Damnation</h3>
			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Champions of Corruption</span> (2014), page 16</p>
			<p>Damnation feats represent a bargain the character has made with some dark power, granting the character great power at the cost of her eternal soul. Damnation feats are distinct from more common feats in three ways.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Damned</span>: A character with a damnation feat is damned (see below). This is likely a permanent condition, but might be avoided through redemption.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Greater Power</span>: Damnation feats increase in power relative to the number of damnation feats a character possesses. Each new damnation feat increases the power of all of the character’s damnation feats, including the newly taken feat and future feats.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Patronage</span>: All damnation feats require the patronage of an evil outsider—typically a daemon, devil, demon, or kyton. This evil outsider patron must be favorably disposed toward the character and must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than her character level. An evil outsider summoned via a spell like planar binding might be coerced to serve as a character’s patron (whether that character is the spell’s caster or another seeking patronage). The caster of a planar binding spell must still attempt Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service, but she gains a +4 bonus on her Charisma checks if that service is to act as a damnation feat’s patron. Other outsiders might more willingly serve as patrons at the GM’s discretion.</p>
			<h4>Damnation</h4>
			<p>When a character takes a damnation feat, his soul is damned. The character’s spirit is promised to a dark power, whether an evil deity or a foul planar race, and his soul will ultimately be consigned to some grim fate after his death. The method by which one becomes damned typically determines the specifics of this eternal doom, but the in-game effects are the same regardless.</p>
			<p>Upon taking a damnation feat, the character’s soul becomes ensnared by dark, otherworldly forces. From that point on, if the character dies, returning him to life proves to be more difficult. Any nonevil spellcaster who attempts to bring the character back from the dead must attempt a caster level check (DC = 10 + the slain character’s Hit Dice). Success means the spell functions as normal, while failure means the spell fails and cannot be attempted again for 24 hours. Evil spellcasters, however, can raise the slain character normally, without a check.</p>
			<p>Upon taking a second damnation feat, the character becomes even more ensnared by his doom. He remains difficult to return from the dead (as noted above), and he can’t be affected by <span class="italic">breath of life</span> or <span class="italic">raise dead</span>, even when these spells are cast by an evil spellcaster. Also, the character’s alignment shifts one step toward evil (typically toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron).</p>
			<p>This corruption continues if the character takes a third damnation feat. He is affected as previously noted, and in addition, the spell <span class="italic">resurrection</span> no longer affects him. The character’s alignment again shifts one step toward evil (typically toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron).
			Finally, upon taking a fourth damnation feat, the character can no longer be returned from the dead by any method short of a <span class="italic">wish</span> or <span class="italic">miracle</span>. The character’s alignment shifts one more step toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron.</p>

			<p>When you gain a new level, if your current familiar does not meet the prerequisite of a familiar feat you possess, you can learn a new familiar feat in place of the feat your familiar doesn’t qualify for.

			<h3 class="hide" id="hide_19">Item Creation</h3>
			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Sources</span>: Too many rulebooks and manuals</p>
			<p>An item creation feat lets a character create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of item each involves, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Raw Materials Cost</span>: The cost of creating a magic item equals half the base price of the item.</p>
			<p>Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he needs unless unusual circumstances apply.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Time</span>: The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Item Cost</span>: Brew Potion, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be low enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</p>
			<p class="center"><span class="italic">Scrolls</span>: Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 25 gp.</p>
			<p class="center"><span class="italic">Potions</span>: Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 50 gp.</p>
			<p class="center"><span class="italic">Wands</span>: Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 750 gp.</p>
			<p class="center"><span class="italic">Staves</span>: The price for staves is calculated using more complex formulas (see Magic Item Creation rules for more details).</p>
			<p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Extra Costs</span>:Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component cost when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend 50 units of the material component. Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Skill Check</span>: Successfully creating a magic item requires a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 5 + the item’s caster level. Alternatively, you can use an associated Craft or Profession skill to attempt this check instead, depending upon the item being crafted. See Magic Item Creation rules for more details on which Craft and Profession checks may be substituted in this manner. The DC of this check can increase if the crafter is rushed or does not meet all of the prerequisites. A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more results in a cursed item.</p>
		</div>
		<h3 class="show" id="show_20">Item Mastery</h3>
		<div class="content" id="20">
			<h3 class="hide" id="hide_20">Item Mastery</h3>
			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span> (2015), page 26</p>
			<p>Using an item mastery feat is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, similar to activating a command word item, though you do not need to speak to use the feat. Creating these effects requires you to assault the existing magic of the item through your force of will and channel the item’s inherent magic through your own body; this act is thus governed by the user’s fortitude. All effects created by item mastery feats act as spell-like abilities and use your base attack bonus as the caster level. Any spell-like ability’s save DC is equal to 10 + the spell level + your Constitution modifier. If a spell-like ability calls for a calculation using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus or modifier, use your Constitution bonus or modifier instead.</p>
			<p>Magic item mastery is stressful for the item as well as the user and can’t be performed on items that can be used only a limited number of times or that must be recharged (such as elixirs, potions, scrolls, staffs, and wands)—it requires items with constant effects or daily uses. Magic item mastery doesn’t affect an item’s normal properties or deplete any of its daily uses.</p>
			<p>The following magic item mastery feats are available to any character who qualifies.</p>

			<p>Meditation provides some of the advantages of a monastic refuge anywhere. While meditation can help any character center herself or calm a troubled mind, those specially trained in the art can use it to unlock fantastic abilities within themselves, reflected in these feats. Meditation feats can be taken by any character who meets the prerequisites, but are most commonly encountered among those who have trained in a monastery.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Monks and Meditation Feats</span>: A monk may take a meditation feat in place of a bonus feat. She must meet all of the prerequisites to take the feat as normal.</p>
		</div>
		<h3 class="show" id="show_22">Metamagic</h3>
		<div class="content" id="22">
			<h3 class="hide" id="hide_22">Metamagic</h3>
			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Sources</span>: Too many rulebooks and manuals</p>
			<p>As a spellcaster’s knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the norm. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up. Metamagic feats do not affect spell-like abilities.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Prepared Spellcasters</span>: Spellcasters like wizards and clerics must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Spontaneous Spellcasters</span>: Spellcasters like sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. Because a spontaneous spellcaster has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell’s normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn’t the same as a 1-round casting time.) The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, which can be cast as normal using the feat.</p>
			<p>For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats</span>: A cleric spontaneously casting a <span class="italic">cure</span> or <span class="italic">inflict</span> spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a <span class="italic">summon nature’s ally</span> spell, can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which can be cast as a swift action.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell</span>: In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast using a higher-level spell slot. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.</p>
			<p>Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don’t eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. Casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can’t modify.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell</span>: A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Magic Items and Metamagic Spells</span>: With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell’s higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn’t need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Counterspelling Metamagic Spells</span>: Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.</p>

			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">AP #28 - The Infernal Syndrome</span> (2009), page 57</p>
			<p>Rare among common fiends, those capable of possession stand out in power above others of their kind. Mastering the ability to discorporate their forms and influence creatures and materials around them, such body thieves are masters of terror and manipulation. Typically only the most extraordinary and perverse fiends can make use of the powers of possession, learning such secrets from blasphemous masters or dark secrets of the multiverse. To represent this, fiends who increase in power beyond the common representatives of their kind gain access to the Possess Creature, Possess Location, and Possess Object feats and the host of terrible abilities they might provide. Using these powers, even a relatively weak fiend can come to possess an area or object, while more powerful horrors might overwhelm a mortal body. Despite the similarity to mind-affecting effects, fiendish possession has more to do with the spiritual hijacking of a body or the physical corruption of objects, and thus, creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are not immune to possession (although several possession actions themselves are mind-affecting). Creatures where the body and spirit are indivisible, as is the case with most outsiders and incorporeal undead, are immune to possession effects.</p>
			<h3>Possession Actions</h3>
			<p>A variety of actions are available to fiends who possess creatures, objects, or locations. GMs are encouraged to use these abilities as guidelines and create similar abilities for their own fiendish villains and extraplanar plots. Each possession action is presented in the following format.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Name</span>: The name of the action in question. The number in parentheses after the name lists the number of possession points (&quot;PP&quot;) the action costs to perform.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Expression</span>: This indicates whether or not the action has a visible effect when it manifests (physical) or if it happens entirely within the host’s head (spiritual). The listed DC indicates the Perception or Sense Motive check required by those nearby to notice the fact that the target is possessed. Note that a possessed creature does not automatically realize that it is possessed, but it gains a +10 bonus on all Perception or Sense Motive checks to notice that it is indeed possessed when the fiend uses a possession action.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Duration</span>: This lists the duration of the effect once the fiend activates the possession action. Durations listed as directly tied to HD use the possessing fiend’s HD to set the duration.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span>: This indicates what sort of saving throw the possessed creature, location, object, or target of the action can make to negate or reduce the effects of the action. In all cases, the DC for this saving throw is DC 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend’s Cha modifier.</p>
			<h4>Bodily Possession</h4>
			<p>A fiend possesses a creature’s body not only to torture its victim, but to torment the possessed creature’s loved ones. More often than not, a fiend aggressively inhabits a host, but sometimes a misguided mortal might call a fiend into his body in search of otherworldly power. This rarely works to the mortal’s advantage, as bodily possession is essentially an abduction of one’s self. Occasionally fiends might grant a taste of power in order to bribe the mortal into compliance with its own wishes and punish actions deviating from their desires, but few fiends possess victims for any other reason than absolute control.</p>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Defile Body (3 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (automatic)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> instantaneous</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Fortitude partial</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend, when displeased, can cause physical harm to the target. This damage manifests in a number of ways, from searing pain to limbs physically wrenched in agonizing ways. Each fiend delivers this damage in a different way, but the damage done always bypasses any damage reduction, resistance, or immunity to damage that the host might possess. If the host fails to resist this ability, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice the fiend possesses. If it makes the Fotitude save, the painful spasms only sicken the host for 1 round.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour or instantaneous</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend may use this action to hide itself from detect spells or to pass through a <span class="italic">magic circle against evil</span> or the effects of a <span class="italic">forbiddance</span> spell. The fiend must make a Will save equal to 10 + the caster level of the spell + the caster’s relevant ability modifier. If it succeeds, the spell only detects the host and in no way hinders or reveals the fiend. If the fiend fails, though, the spells treat the host as if it were the fiend, providing information or barring the host as such.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, a fiend may spend an additional possession point as a swift action when activating any other possession action to make that action elusive. This supresses that possession action’s expression, increasing the DC to notice the effect by +10.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend causes its host to undergo a terrible change. Any creature subject to the alter appearance action must succeed on a Will save. If the host fails, the possessing fiend manifests a hint of its presence, perhaps in the form of glowing eyes, an inhuman growl, a ghastly stench, or spontaneous bleeding. This manifestation is obvious to anyone looking at the host. As long as the manifestation persists, the host creature suffers a –2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour/HD or until completed</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>Some possessing fiends wish to remain hidden, even from their victims. To do so, a fiend and its host make opposed Wisdom checks. If the host succeeds, it is aware that some force beyond itself is manipulating it. If the fiend succeeds, it may communicate a simple idea to its host via telepathy, as per the spell <span class="italic">suggestion</span>. Alternatively, it may prevent its host from acknowledging a possession action it uses in the next round, even if such has a blatant visual effect—the host simply has no memory of having done anything out of the ordinary. This ability automatically activates the elusive presence ability and cannot be made further elusive through the use of elusive presence. This ability is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>Throw The possessing fiend twists positive moods and feelings toward a foul temperament. A fiend using this action forces its host to make a Will save or experience despondent or depressive emotions. A host affected by this ability becomes sickened for the duration of the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend causes its host to rise into the air, manifesting a degree of its malign control over its victim’s body. This effect is similar to the spell <span class="italic">levitate</span>, which the fiend has complete control over and may end at will. The host may make a Will save to resist this effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Read Thoughts (5 PP)</h4>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> concentration, up to 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend taps into the mind of the creature it possesses. Like the spell <span class="italic">detect thoughts</span>, a fiend may peruse the surface thoughts of the host. Unlike the spell, a fiend automatically skips the first and second round results and immediately reads the target it possesses if the host fails a Will save.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Vile Gout (5 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (automatic)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> instantaneous</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates, Reflex half</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend causes a blast of unnatural force to explode from its host’s body. This takes the form of a 15-foot cone of acid, fire, cold, or sonic energy—typically mixed with bodily fluids or unnatural expulsions—that deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice the fiend possesses. The host may make a Will save to negate this effect. Those within the area of the gout can make a Reflex save to take half damage.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> instantaneous or 1 round/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>A possessing fiend can use this action to learn more about its host’s past experiences. Fiends using this action essentially ask a question of a host’s mind, forcing the host to make a Will save. If the fiend succeeds, it gains the answer to its question if the host possesses such information. Alternatively, a fiend might merely seek painful memories or vague details pertinent to an event, location, or individual. If the host fails its save, the painful memories stagger him for 1 round per HD of the possessing fiend.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Fortitue negates</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend decreases its host’s ability scores. If the host fails to resist this ability, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to an ability score chosen by the fiend. A fiend cannot reduce a single ability score below 1 by using this ability. Typically, a fiend uses this ability to punish unfavorable actions its host takes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Empower Host (7 PP)</h4>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates (harmless)</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend enhances its host’s prowess by granting a +2 profane bonus to one of its host’s ability scores chosen by the fiend. A host can resist this benefit by making a Will save. A possessing fiend may grant this bonus multiple times to either the same or different abilities (additional profane bonuses to the same ability stack when granted by a possessing fiend). Typically, these bonuses also cause some subtle side effect, such as writhing veins rising from one’s muscles or a subtly forked tongue. These expressions of fiendish influence have no additional effect and are only noticeable to those who closely examine the host.</p>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 round/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend takes control over its host’s body and actions. If the host fails to resist this ability, the fiend can direct the creature to attack, cast spells, or otherwise perform any other action so desired. Every round, a dominated host may attempt an additional Will save to break the fiend’s control. A fiend cannot dominate a creature more than 4 Hit Dice higher than itself. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

			<div class="box">
				<h4>Erase Memories (9 PP)</h4>

				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> instantaneous</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>This powerful ability allows a possessing fiend to selectively alter a host’s memories. When using this action, a fiend can manipulate the memories experienced by the host as per the spell <span class="italic">modify memory</span>. The host may make a Will save to avoid this effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Make Pact (9 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> spiritual (Sense Motive DC 35)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> see below</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A possessing fiend and its host constantly struggle for mastery of the body they both possess. Sometimes, though, these two opposing spirits reach an accord, coming to at least a temporary understanding and degree of shared control. In such cases, a fiend and its host may agree to a pact. Both parties must agree to the terms of a pact, usually taking the form of an arrangement where the host allows the fiend to perform some act without his resistance and the fiend allows the host freedom to undertake some act without its interference. This effect takes the form of two <span class="italic">geas/quest</span> effects, both affecting the same body but under different terms—one stated by the host and one by the fiend. The host and fiend decide in advance in which order their goals will be pursued. As this arrangement must be voluntary, no save is required. This is not a spell effect and cannot be removed by spells that normally affect <span class="italic">geas/quest</span>; rather, the fiendish or mortal personality compels the body to a certain stated course. When both parties have completed their goals, the pact ends. Fiends typically attempt to mislead or confuse their host with the terms or weight of their side of a pact, but so long as the host agrees to a pact and the stated goals of the pact remain the same, the host cannot renege due to specifics. A pact does not necessarily represent cooperation between a fiend and its host, however, as some fiends use this action as a contract in order to ensure the host fulfills obligations.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Transfer Spell-Like Ability (9 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (Perception DC 30)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates (harmless)</p>
				<p>The possessing fiend grants its host a taste of its unnatural powers. The fiend imbues its host with the ability to utilize one of its spell-like abilities (chosen by the fiend) for the ability’s duration. Utilizing this spell-like ability is a standard action for the host, but is treated as being used by the fiend for the purposes of determining caster level and save DCs. A host might be able to utilize this ability multiple times, but cannot use it more times per day than the fiend itself could. Typically a fiend uses this action as a way to endear the host to its presence or as a way to show the greater power of its fiendish ways.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Exorcism</h4>
			<p>Combating possession ranks among the most unusual and dangerous acts heroes might ever have to perform.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Detecting Possession</span>: Spells like <span class="italic">detect evil</span> reveal contradictory information when targeting the victim of fiendish influence, revealing multiple auras emanating from one being. Skilled exorcists might also detect a possession. Both Perception (for physical effects) and Sense Motive (for spiritual effects) might reveal a fiend as its possession actions influence an individual, though they do nothing to detect a dormant fiend.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Ending Possession</span>: The most direct way to expel a possessing fiend is via <span class="italic">banishment</span>, <span class="italic">dismissal</span>, or <span class="italic">dispel evil</span> (or <span class="italic">dispel law</span> or <span class="italic">dispel chaos</span>, depending on the type of fiend). These spells drive the fiend from its host, but do not return the creature to its home plane, typically causing the monstrosity to manifest in its true form nearby. Many fiends, however, find this kind of exposure counterproductive to their ultimate goals and flee to seek another suitable host, while others might become enraged and attack the meddling exorcist.</p>
			<p>A far riskier method of ending a possession involves an invitation by the exorcist to the possessing fiend to leave its current host to take up residence in the exorcist’s body (or in the body of a nearby volunteer). An exorcist can force a possessing fiend to leave its current host and attempt the new possession by making a successful Intimidate check to demoralize the fiend. Typically, the exorcist taking such a bold risk hopes to make his own saving throw to resist the possession or protects himself with magic before making this risky attempt. If the fiend fails to possess the exorcist, it can immediately try to repossess its original host, who can attempt to resist this possession by making a Will save. If the fiend fails to return to its host, it manifests in its physical form in a space adjacent to the host, and is typically infuriated.</p>
			<h3>Object Possession</h3>
			<p>A fiend possesses objects either as a way to control them or as a way to infiltrate a body in a clandestine manner. A fiend in possession of an object can perform the following possession actions. Unless otherwise specified, these actions take a full-round action. While possessing an object, a fiend retains its normal senses, and may sense in every direction around the object, but otherwise perceives its surroundings as normal. Often a possessed item exhibits unusual characteristics, such as an unnatural tarnish, an accumulation of greasy film on its surface, or an unnaturally temperature. Even when these effects are not present, a creature can detect something strange about the item by utilizing spells like <span class="italic">detect evil</span>.</p>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Seed (3 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> spiritual (Sense Motive 30)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>The fiend weakens the will of a creature in contact with the object it possesses. This action causes a creature holding the possessed object to gradually become more vulnerable to the possessing fiend’s influence. Upon using this ability, a fiend subtly invades the mind of a creature touching the item it possesses. After 5 minutes, if the same creature has remained in contact with the possessed object, the target takes a –4 penalty on Will saves made to resist attempts by that fiend to possess its body. This effect lasts for 24 hours. The target does not receive a saving throw against this effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Read User (5 PP)</h4>

				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>The fiend taps into the mind of a creature in contact with the object it possesses. This action mimics the <span class="italic">detect thoughts</span> spell, except that the possessing fiend immediately picks up on the surface thoughts of the creature touching the object. The target may attempt a Will save to block the fiend from its mind. This effect continues for as long as the target remains in contact with the possessed object.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Animation, Minor (7 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (automatic)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 round/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing an object can cause that object to move at its command. This allows a fiend to cause any object of Large size or smaller to function as an animated object for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Alternatively, a fiend can merely cause the object to <span class="italic">levitate</span>, as per the spell, for the same amount of time.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Corrupt User (7 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> spiritual (Sense Motive DC 30)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour/HD or until completed</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>The fiend influences the actions of a creature in contact with the object it possesses, telepathically implanting a suggestion (as per the spell <span class="italic">suggestion</span>). While acting upon this suggestion, the target’s alignment is detected as being the same as the fiend’s. This does not change the way in which the target acts, merely how alignment-revealing magic perceives him. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Dispel Enhancement (7 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing a magic item can suppress the imbued magic of the object for a short period. To use this action, the fiend makes a special dispel check (1d20 + the fiend’s HD, maximum +10) against the caster level of the magic item. If the fiend succeeds, all magical properties of the item are suppressed for a number of hours equal to the fiend’s Hit Dice, or until the fiend chooses to end the effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Reinvigoration (7 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (automatic)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing an object may transpose a portion of its being into a corpse within 10 feet per HD of the object’s possessing fiend. This allows the fiend to raise skeletons and zombies as per the spell <span class="italic">animate dead</span>. The possessing fiend’s Hit Dice serve as the caster level for the purposes of this effect. This use of <span class="italic">animate dead</span> does not require a material component, but the undead created are not permanent, collapsing back to corpses as soon as the ability’s duration expires.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Enhance (9 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (Perception 20)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 day</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing an object can imbue the item with its profane energies to mimic magical enchantment. When a fiend uses this action, it grants the possessed item magical properties equal to 1,000 gp per Hit Die the fiend possesses. This action is typically used on weapons and armor, though a fiend can duplicate other magic items if it possesses an appropriate item. The possessed item does not need to be of masterwork quality for the fiend to bestow these magical properties. For example, a 9-HD erinyes can imbue an item with up to 9,000 gp worth of magical properties. Thus the erinyes can make a normal longsword perform as if it were a <span class="italic">+2 longsword</span> or even a <span class="italic">+1 vicious longsword</span>. Likewise, the same erinyes could possess an amulet and cause it to act as an <span class="italic">amulet of natural armor +2</span>.</p>
				<p>The fiend, and not the user of the object, is in control of the properties of the item, even if it has been forced into possessing the item via a spell like <span class="italic">planar ally</span> or <span class="italic">planar binding</span>. Each use of this ability lasts for 24 hours or until the fiend dismisses the effect. The fiend can remove these properties at will, and when the fiend leaves the item, the magical properties immediately vanish. A fiend cannot cause an item to take on properties other than those typical to its shape (one could not create a <span class="italic">+1 vicious helmet</span>, for example).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Animation, Major (13 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (automatic)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 round/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing an object can cause that object and those around it to move at its command. This effect is identical to the <span class="italic">animate objects</span> spell, except that the object the fiend possesses must be included among the items to be animated. The possessing fiend’s Hit Dice serve as the caster level for the purposes of this effect. In addition, all animated objects gain a fly speed equal to the fiend’s highest movement speed with perfect maneuverability.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Possessed Locations</h3>
			<p>A fiend can nestle itself within a location in order to taint the place with evil and potentially corrupt or assault a number of targets. Fiends possessing places generally choose locations already welcoming of evil, or mundane sites with little worry for matters otherworldly. A fiend possess a distinct, roughly spherical space based on its Hit Dice. This location might be as simple as a single room in a building, or an entire castle. An imp spy might possess the town’s well, while a maralith might influence an entire demon-tainted grove. While in possession of a location, a fiend can perform a small number of actions, usually in the interest of finding a suitable creature for bodily possession. Some fiends possess their lairs as a way to maintain awareness throughout an area and more easily enslave interlopers and minions.</p>
			<p>A fiend in possession of a location can perform the following possession actions. Unless otherwise specified, these actions take a full-round action. While possessing a location, a fiend sees everything within the area it possesses, using its own senses. It perceives areas outside of this space as if it were a viewer standing at any edge of its possessed area. Often a possessed area exhibits unusual characteristics, such as strange temperature shifts, eerie noises, or noxious scents. Even when these effects are not present, a creature can detect something strange about the location by utilizing spells like detect evil.</p>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Seed Area (5 pp)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> spiritual (Sense Motive DC 30)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> 1 hour</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> none</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing a location weakens the willpower of those within its area, allowing an easier path to bodily possession. Upon using this ability, a fiend subtly invades the mind of a creature within the location it inhabits. After 5 minutes, if the same creature has remained within the possessed area, the target takes a –2 penalty on Will saves made to resist attempts by that fiend to possess its body. This effect last for 24 hours. The target does not receive a saving throw against this effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Read Inhabitants (7 PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> spiritual (Sense Motive DC 15)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> concentration, up to 1 minute/HD</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> Will negates</p>
				<p>A fiend can tap into the mind of creatures in the area it possesses. This action mimics the spell <span class="italic">detect thoughts</span> with a caster level equal to the fiend’s Hit Dice. The targets of this action can attempt Will saves throw to resist this effect.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h4>Dominion (variable PP)</h4>
				<p><span class="bold">Expression</span> physical (Perception DC 20)</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Duration</span> see below</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Saving Throw</span> see below</p>
				<p>A fiend possessing a location can manipulate the area it controls to terrifying ends. At will, the fiend can make use of any of the following spell-like abilities to affect creatures within the area it possesses. It can &quot;cast&quot; these spell-like abilities from any physical point within the area of its possessed location.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">0 (1 PP)</span>—<span class="italic">dancing lights</span>, <span class="italic">ghost sound</span>, <span class="italic">open/close</span>, <span class="italic">prestidigitation</span>, <span class="italic">whispering wind</span></li>
					<li><span class="bold">1st (3 PP)</span>—<span class="italic">animate rope</span>, <span class="italic">grease</span>, <span class="italic">hold portal</span>, <span class="italic">hypnotism</span>, <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span>, <span class="italic">sleep</span>, <span class="italic">silent image</span>, <span class="italic">unseen servant</span></li>
					<li><span class="bold">2nd (5 PP)</span>—<span class="italic">command undead</span>, <span class="italic">darkness</span>, <span class="italic">gust of wind</span>, <span class="italic">magic mouth</span>, <span class="italic">make whole</span>, <span class="italic">misdirection</span>, <span class="italic">phantom trap</span>, <span class="italic">shatter</span>, <span class="italic">sound burst</span></li>

				</ul>
				<p>In every case, the caster level for these spell-like abilities equals the possessing fiend’s Hit Dice and the cost in possession points equals 1 + the spell's level. None of these effects, regardless of its potential range or space, extends beyond the space of the fiend’s possession.</p>

			<p>To some combatants shields are just as important, if not more so, than weapons or armor. Shields are multipurpose, capable of defense or offense. They slide on and off far faster than armor, and allow adventurers to change their tactics on a whim.</p>
			<p>A handful of specialists train to maximize a shield’s use in battle. Presented here are new feats categorized as shield mastery feats, each requiring Shield Focus as a prerequisite. Characters with the armor training class feature can ignore the Shield Focus feat as a prerequisite for shield mastery feats.

			<p>A story feat reflects a goal—often an all-consuming one—that shapes your life. Each story feat incorporates a trigger event (which comes from either a campaign occurrence or your background), an immediate benefit, a goal, and a further benefit for achieving that goal. Each feat has at least two possible prerequisites, representing conditions most likely met during play or a background that fits the feat. You need to meet only one of these prerequisites. Anytime you gain a new feat, you may take a story feat, but you can have only one uncompleted story feat at a time. Story feats are designed for PCs, but can be taken by NPCs and monsters as well.</p>
			<p>Unlike typical feats, story feats have nebulous prerequisites, and you should chose one only after talking with the GM. The GM should weave a story feat into the greater story of the campaign and even adjust it as needed to fit the campaign’s long-term goals and the specifics of your background. Story feats should work organically within the story of the campaign, rather than be chosen purely for their mechanical benefits.</p>
			<p>Like the prerequisites, the completion conditions for a story feat might require GM adjudication. If the events of the campaign are not likely to resolve the story implied by the story feat, the GM should consider shifting the goal to something you can achieve. Establishing a meaningful story arc is more important than adhering to the letter of the feat.</p>
			<p>Because a story feat represents both your motivation and character development, the GM should make an effort to incorporate elements related to the feat into the ongoing campaign. These can be direct elements, like the appearance of a villain or hated creature, or indirect elements, such as rumors of the fate of a lost relative or NPCs who are impressed by a PC’s artistic endeavors. A good rule of thumb is to work in a reference to each PC’s story feat once every three to five sessions. In most cases, allies can assist in completing a story feat. At the GM’s discretion, if you do not take a leadership role in tasks or conflicts related to your own story feat, you might need to complete additional goals to resolve the story feat, or might even be denied completion altogether.</p>
			<h3>Common Rules</h3>
			<p>Many story feats share similar terminology in their prerequisites and completion conditions. The following terms have special meanings when used in story feats.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Appropriate Number</span>: These are either creatures whose individual CRs add up to 20, or creatures whose individual CRs add up to 5 times your character level, whichever is greater. For example, if you’re at 6th level, an appropriate number of creatures have CRs that add up to 30. This calculation is based on your current character level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. Overly easy challenges (encounters with CRs of 3 or more below your character level) don’t count unless circumstances make them much more difficult to handle.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Challenging Foe</span>: This is a foe or group of foes with a total CR of 10 or a CR of 3 plus your character level, whichever is higher. If this refers to a distinct individual, the foe’s CR is set when the feat is taken, but the foe advances in power as you do. Otherwise, it refers to your current level. A typical recurring foe advances in CR by 1 for every 1–2 levels you gain.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Character’s Level</span>: Normally, this is your actual character level. If you’re a creature best represented by CR rather than character level (such as most monsters with more than 1 HD), use your calculated CR instead of your character level.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Decisively Defeat</span>: You overcome a foe in some way, such as by killing the creature, knocking it unconscious, or causing it to be taken prisoner. You must be a significant participant in the conflict to defeat the opponent, even if another strikes the final blow. Whether or not merely causing the enemy to flee qualifies is up to the GM. Generally, driving off an enemy while causing little actual harm does not qualify as a decisive defeat.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Slay</span>: Slaying a foe includes killing it, destroying it, turning it to stone, banishing it to the Abyss, or otherwise eliminating it in a fashion reversible only by powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, you must deal the final blow yourself to slay a creature.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Thwart</span>: Distinct from defeating a foe, thwarting a foe involves disrupting its plans in a substantial and essentially permanent fashion. Deposing a lord, bringing down a priest’s temple, or banishing a sorcerer to the depths of Hell all qualify as thwarting. You keep any benefits gained by thwarting a foe even if it survives defeat and returns more powerful than before. You must be a significant participant in the events that lead to your foe being thwarted for your actions to count toward fulfilling a story requirement.</p>

			<p>For centuries, great warriors have looked to nature and the multiverse to find inspiration in battle. Countless monastic and contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to practitioners the world over.</p>
			<p>As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you spend a swift action to switch to a different combat style. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while in the stance of the associated style. For example, if you have feats associated with Mantis Style and Tiger Style, you can use a swift action to adopt Tiger Style at the start of one turn, and then can use other feats that have Tiger Style as a prerequisite. By using another swift action at the start of your next turn, you could adopt Mantis Style and use other feats that have Mantis Style as a prerequisite.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Editor's Note</span>: Style feats can be a bit confusing. Sometimes only the base feats are marked as style feats, while the &quot;upgraded versions&quot; are only marked as combat feats. Sometimes all the style chain (usually composed of three feats) is marked as style feats. I decided to mark each and every feat in such chain as style feats for consistency. So when the instructions above speaks of stances, it refers to the base feat, the one that usually has the word &quot;Style&quot; in its name, for example Tiger Style, while the feats that need the style feat as prerequisite are usually (but not limited to) the following feats in the chain, for example Tiger Claws and Tiger Pounce.</p>

			<p class="source"><span class="bold">Sources</span>: Too many rulebooks and manuals</p>
			<p>Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no benefits if the given conditions are not met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don’t have those feats.</p>

			<p>Trick feats allows mesmerists—as well as other characters capable of taking mesmerist tricks—to modify their tricks by altering or expanding how they can be used. A target can be implanted with only one mesmerist trick that has been modified by a trick feat at a time, and a single mesmerist trick can be modified by only one trick feat.</p>

			<p>Although most combat techniques are general enough to be categorized as combat feats, some require such a high level of martial skill that they are instead categorized as weapon mastery feats. Weapon mastery feats count as combat feats for all purposes, including which classes can select them as bonus feats, and you gain the benefits of a weapon mastery feat only while wielding a weapon that belongs to a fighter weapon group that you have selected with the fighter weapon training class feature (referred to as an &quot;appropriate weapon&quot;), and any effect of these feats related to attacks applies only to attacks from such weapons unless the feat specifies otherwise. Characters who lack the weapon training class feature can access weapon mastery feats by taking the Martial Focus feat.</p>
