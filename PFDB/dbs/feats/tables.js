	<li><span class="italic">Dust (Air/Earth)</span>: Choked by dust, the targets must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. Targeted spellcasters must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (the DC is equal to the save DC). On a successful save, the targets are not staggered but must still attempt concentration checks.</li>
	<li><span class="italic">Lava (Earth/Fire)</span>: The targets are splattered with bits of molten rock and take 1d6 points of fire damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire.</li>

	<li><span class="italic">Smoke (Air/Fire)</span>: The targets suffer smoke inhalation and must succeed at Fortitude saves or become nauseated for 1 round and blinded for 1d4 rounds. Success negates the nausea effect and reduces the blindness to 1 round. Creatures immune to fire are immune to the nausea effect.</li>
	<li><span class="italic">Snow (Air/Water)</span>: The primary spell gains the cold descriptor if it doesn't have that descriptor already, and half the damage dealt (if any) is cold damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone.</li>
	<li><span class="italic">Steam (Fire/Water)</span>: Damage caused by the primary spell (if any) is treated as nonlethal, untyped damage (neither cold nor fire damage) and is not affected by energy resistance or absorbed by protection from energy. The targets become blinded for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Will save.</li>

	<h4>Acrobatics</h4>
	With sufficient ranks in Acrobatics, you earn the following.<br />
	<span class="bold">5 Ranks</span>: You can move at normal speed through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity by increasing the DC of the check by 5 (instead of by 10). You aren't denied your Dexterity bonus when attempting Acrobatics checks with DCs of 20 or lower.<br />
	<span class="bold">10 Ranks</span>: You can attempt an Acrobatics check at a -10 penalty and use the result as your CMD against trip maneuvers. You can also attempt an Acrobatics check at a -10 penalty in place of a Reflex save to avoid falling. You must choose to use this ability before the trip attempt or Reflex save is rolled. With a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check, you treat an unintentional fall as 10 feet shorter plus 10 feet for every 10 by which you exceed the DC, and treat an intentional fall as 10 feet shorter for every 10 by which you exceed the DC.<br />

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Appraise</h4>
	With sufficient ranks in Appraise, you earn the following.<br />
	<span class="bold">5 Ranks</span>: A successful DC 20 Appraise check reveals whether an item is magical, and a second check (DC = 25 + the item's caster level) unveils its properties. You can use Appraise to detect non-written forgeries and counterfeits.<br />
	<span class="bold">10 Ranks</span>: You can determine the most expensive object a creature is wearing or wielding (or in a 5-foot cube) as a standard action by succeeding at a DC 20 check. You never make a wildly inaccurate appraisal of an item's value.<br />
	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: Determining the most expensive object as above is a move action. You can substitute an Appraise check at a -10 penalty for a Will save to disbelieve a figment or glamer.<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: Determining the most expensive object as above is a move action, and if the check succeeds, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to steal that object or disarm a creature of that object for 1 minute.

A creature that saves against your <span class="italic">suggestion</span> is immune to further uses of this effect for 24 hours, and whenever the suggested creature is specifically confronted with proof of your manipulation, it receives another saving throw. This is an extraordinary mind-affecting compulsion.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Climb</h4>

	<span class="bold">5 Ranks</span>: You are no longer denied your Dexterity bonus when climbing.<br />

	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: You gain a natural climb speed (but not the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks) equal to your base speed on surfaces with a Climb DC of 20 or lower, and of 10 feet on all other surfaces.<br />

<div class="box1">

	With sufficient ranks in Disable Device, you earn the following.<br />

	<span class="bold">10 Ranks</span>: You can disarm magical traps at a -10 penalty even if you lack the trapfinding ability. If you possess the trapfinding ability, when attempting to disable magic traps, you never trigger them, even if you perform the trigger action (such as looking at a symbol). If you fail the check, you can still trigger the trap, and you can't use this ability to bypass it.<br />
	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: When attacked by a trap, you can attempt a Disable Device check as an immediate action (adding your trap sense bonus, if any) opposed by the trap's attack roll or its save DC. If you succeed, you take half damage (or no damage if you exceed the DC by at least 10).<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: You halve the penalties for performing a quick disarm as described in the 5 Ranks entry. If you possess the trapfinding ability and accept a -20 penalty while using the ability unlocked at 15 ranks, all nearby allies gain the benefit, and you disable the trap as an immediate action before it can trigger if you exceed the DC by at least 10.

	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: You can create a disguise as a full-round action.<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: You can create a disguise as a standard action, or as a full-round action combined with a Bluff check to create a diversion to hide.

	<span class="bold">10 Ranks</span>: You can attempt to escape from any entangling effect as a standard action with an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's save DC + 10). You can attempt an Escape Artist check as a move action to set the DC for a creature to escape from ropes or bindings; you gain a +10 bonus on the check if you instead attempt it as a full-round action.<br />
	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: You can escape any entangling effect (as above) as a move action. As a standard action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's save DC + 20) to suppress a slow or paralysis effect for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 by which you exceed the DC.

If you succeed, you gain a +1 bonus on the initiative check, plus an additional +1 for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC.<br />
	<span class="bold">10 Ranks</span>: After 1 minute of conversation, you can read a creature's surface thoughts (as <span class="italic">detect thoughts</span>)by attempting a Sense Motive check at a -20 penalty opposed by the creature's Bluff check.<br />
	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: You can read surface thoughts as above after 1 round. In addition, when attacked, you can attempt a Sense Motive check as an immediate action opposed by your target's attack roll. A successful check grants a +2 insight bonus to your AC against attacks from that specific opponent for 1 minute.<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: You can read surface thoughts as above as a standard action. A successful check to gain an insight bonus to your AC also negates the attack that triggered it.

	With sufficient ranks in Sleight of Hand, you earn the following.<br />
	<span class="bold">5 Ranks</span>: When attempting a disarm or steal maneuver, a successful Sleight of Hand check against your target's CMD grants a +2 circumstance bonus on your combat maneuver check.<br />
	<span class="bold">10 Ranks</span>: The penalty for attempting a Sleight of Hand check (including drawing a hidden weapon) as a move action is reduced to -10.<br />
	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: You can attempt a Sleight of Hand check (including drawing a hidden weapon) as a swift action at a -20 penalty.<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: You take no penalty for using Sleight of Hand as a move action, and take only a -10 penalty when using it as a swift action.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Spellcraft</h4>

	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: Whenever you attempt a caster level check, attempt a Spellcraft check at a -20 penalty at the same DC. If the spellcraft check succeeds, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your caster level check.

	With sufficient ranks in Stealth, you earn the following.<br />
	<span class="bold">5 Ranks</span>: Reduce the Stealth penalty from sniping by 10.<br />

	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: If you attack after successfully using Stealth, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus against all attacks that you make before the beginning of your next turn.

	<h4>Survival</h4>
	With sufficient ranks in Survival, you earn the following.<br />
	<span class="bold">5 Ranks</span>: You reduce all nonlethal damage you take from heat, cold, starvation, or thirst by 1 point for every 5 ranks you possess in Survival.<br />

	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: Once per day, you can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 30 Survival check. Success grants you cold resistance or fire resistance 5 for 24 hours. You can share this with one ally for every 5 by which you exceeded the check.<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: You take only a -10 penalty when tracking creatures that leave no tracks.

	<span class="bold">15 Ranks</span>: You can use this skill to emulate two races or two alignments simultaneously.<br />
	<span class="bold">20 Ranks</span>: If you roll a natural 1 when activating an item, you can reroll the check at a -10 penalty to activate the item. You must take the result of the second check, even if it is worse, and you can't reroll it again.

// 36: Armor Trick
`<div class="box1">
	<h4>Light Armor Tricks</h4>
	Light armor tricks are rarely taught in formal schools, though some can be learned from experienced Freemen on the streets of Kaer Maga or the leaders of the Bloody Barbers thieves' guild in Absalom. These armor tricks are often used to supplement the modest defense provided by lighter armors by maximizing flexibility and mobility.<br />
	<span class="bold">Combat Acrobatics (Int 13, Combat Expertise, Acrobatics 3 ranks)</span>: You have trained yourself to expose only armored sections of your body when performing flips and rolls, leaving you less distracted by concerns about being struck in combat. You are not considered flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling, and do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. Additionally, if you use Combat Expertise to increase your AC, the DC for you to use Acrobatics to move through a threatened square at full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity by 10 does not increase.<br />
	<span class="bold">Reactive Mobility (Mobility, Nimble Moves)</span>: Practice has honed your reactions so that you react quickly and instinctively to threats. You add your dodge bonus granted by Mobility to your AC against all attacks of opportunity that you provoke, not just against those that are caused when you move out of or within a threatened area.<br />
	<span class="bold">Reflexive Mobility (Combat Reflexes, Mobility)</span>: You have learned to sacrifice an opportunity to wound an opponent in order to avoid being wounded yourself. When you provoke an attack of opportunity from an opponent, you can expend one of your own potential attacks of opportunity for that round to double the bonus to your AC that you gain from the Mobility feat against that attack. This benefit applies to all attacks of opportunity that you provoke with the same action. If you are unable to take any more attacks of opportunity this turn, you cannot use this ability.<br />
	<span class="bold">Sliding Charge (Improved Trip, base attack bonus +4)</span>: You can use your momentum to confound your opponents. Whenever you charge an opponent and attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent as a melee attack, you can drop to the ground as a swift action in order to slide into your target. When doing so, you add your Dexterity bonus (up to your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus) to the combat maneuver check. Whether or not you succeed at the check, you are prone at the end of your charge.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Medium Armor Tricks</h4>
	Many of these armor tricks originated in Andoran and are employed by various branches of the Eagle Knights, who highly value the greater protection provided by medium armor but want to retain flexibility and agility in combat.<br />
	<span class="bold">Acrobatic Sit-Up (Mobility, Acrobatics 5 ranks)</span>: You have developed the ability to recover from a fall and attack an opponent in a single fluid movement. Whenever you are prone, you can make an attack against a single foe and stand from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity from that foe. Make a single melee attack against one target without the normal penalties for attacking while prone. If you hit your target, you can immediately stand from prone (normally a move action) without provoking an attack of opportunity from that target for doing so. Any other target that threatens you can still make an attack of opportunity against you. If your attack fails, you provoke attacks of opportunity from all threatening foes and cannot stand until your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Heavy Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Heavy Armor])</span>: You take advantage of all the defensive capabilities your armor can offer. You can treat medium armor as heavy armor for the purpose of which armor tricks you can perform in it.<br />
	<span class="bold">Light Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Light Armor])</span>: You are so comfortable in your armor that it seems lighter than it is. You can treat medium armor as light armor for the purpose of what armor tricks you can perform in it.<br />
	<span class="bold">Roll into the Blow (Mobility)</span>: You keep your wits about you when attacked and can turn the situation to your advantage. Once per day when you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can lunge toward your attacker, throwing it off-balance. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on all melee attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.<br />
	<span class="bold">Versatile Armor (Combat Expertise)</span>: You can adjust how you present yourself and maneuver in your armor to maximize your speed and mobility or to maximize your defenses. While using your armor for speed, your movement is not affected by your armor and its armor check penalty and armor bonus to AC both decrease by 2. While using your armor for defense, your armor's check penalty increases by 3 and its armor bonus to AC increases by 1. Adjusting how you use your armor is a move action, and the adjustment remains until you change it, take off your armor, or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Heavy Armor Tricks</h4>
	These armor tricks are most common among the various Hellknight orders, though their secrets have spread to other organizations and fighter schools. Such armor tricks utilize the mass and heft of heavy armor, and don't function when you're wearing heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor for any purpose, unless the heavy armor trick says otherwise.<br />
	<span class="bold">Blade among the Folds (Sleight of Hand 3 ranks)</span>: You are adept at concealing small weapons in your armor. While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a light melee weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow, within your armor. In addition, a searcher doesn't gain the usual +4 bonus on Perception checks to find the hidden weapon as long as you are wearing your armor, even if the searcher frisks you. This trick functions even in heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor.<br />
	<span class="bold">Protected Limbs (Combat Expertise)</span>: Whenever you attempt a disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC against any attack of opportunity you provoke as a result of attempting the combat maneuver check, and to your CMD against any combat maneuver your foe attempts against you before the beginning of your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Shrug It Off (Great Fortitude)</span>: Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by a confirmed critical hit or sneak attack, you can direct the blow to the thickest section of your armor to lessen the damage dealt. This reduces the attack to dealing its minimum damage, though it remains a successful critical hit or sneak attack (the minimum damage calculated includes all additional dice for the critical hit or sneak attack, and any abilities that apply due to it being a critical hit or sneak attack function normally). You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.<br />
	<span class="bold">Steel-Plated Smasher (Power Attack)</span>: You gain a bonus equal to 1/4 of your armor's armor check penalty (not including any reduction to the armor check penalty from class features or feats) on Strength checks to break doors and objects with less hardness than your armor. When your base attack bonus reaches +8, this bonus increases to 1/2 your armor's armor check penalty. When your base attack bonus reaches +16, this bonus increases to equal your armor's full armor check penalty.

	<h4>Gatefinder (Perception)</h4>
	<span class="bold">Check</span>: You are familiar with soulgates and might notice those with an alignment matching your own. To notice a soulgate that you're not already familiar with, you must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check; this DC could be higher if the portal is obscured or damaged, or at the GM's discretion. If the soulgate shares your exact alignment, you gain a +5 bonus on your check to notice the portal, feeling an instinctual draw toward it. If your alignment and the portal's share none of the same components, you take a -5 penalty on your check to notice the portal. If your alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, you take no penalties on checks to find soulgates.<br />For example, a lawful good character would gain a +5 bonus on her Perception checks to find lawful good soulgates, but would take a -5 penalty on checks to find chaotic evil, chaotic neutral, and neutral evil soulgates, as she has no chaotic, neutral, or evil components to her alignment. A neutral character, however, gains a +5 bonus on checks to find neutral gates, but gains no bonus on checks to find chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral good, and neutral evil soulgates. Additionally, she takes no penalty on checks to notice chaotic good, chaotic evil, lawful good, or lawful evil soulgates.<br />Once you are aware of a soulgate, you never need to succeed at a Perception check to find that particular gate again, as long as some remarkable event doesn't change its appearance or location.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Gatekeeper (Knowledge [Planes])</h4>
	<span class="bold">Check</span>: Once you are aware of a soulgate, you can use your knowledge of the planes and your place as a child of the multiverse to attempt to open the portal. This attempt takes 1 minute to perform. The DC of the Knowledge (planes) check to open a soulgate is 30. If your alignment perfectly matches that of the soulgate, you gain a +5 bonus on this check. You can also attempt to open a soulgate with an alignment that is within one step of your own. However, unless you are neutral, you cannot open a soulgate with an alignment two or more steps away from your own.<br />For example, a lawful evil character would gain a +5 bonus on her attempt to open a soulgate connecting the Material Plane to Hell (lawful evil) or other planes of lawful evil alignment. She can also attempt to open soulgates to Abaddon (neutral evil), Axis (lawful neutral), and other planes that share those planes' alignments, because their alignments are one step away from lawful evil. She can never open a soulgate to the Abyss (chaotic evil), the Boneyard (neutral), Elysium (chaotic good), Heaven (lawful good), the Maelstrom (chaotic neutral), Nirvana (neutral good), or any other plane with those alignments.<br />If your alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, you can open soulgates with an alignment two steps away from your own, but you take a -10 penalty on attempts to do so.<br />Once opened, you can keep a soulgate open for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. An open soulgate closes at the end of that time, or you can close it earlier as a standard action.

// 38: Draconic Heritage
`<h3>True Dragons</h3>
<p>Though it is still uncommon, true dragons are most likely to interact directly with humanoid races, though a few take on humanoid forms and move among mortals until the time is right to reveal themselves. Such dragons rarely adopt these guises for long, as those who lose themselves in humanoid form are seen as pariahs by their own kind.</p>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Chromatic</h4>
	While not all who carry the blood of chromatic dragons are evil, the potency of their blood and the malevolence inherent in it can have strong subconscious effects, tempting them to embrace their sinister urges. Humanoids with blood empowered by chromatic dragons tend toward muscular builds and can imbue their fists with the dragons' energy.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: Choose acid, cold, electricity or fire when you take this feat; the choice cannot be changed once made. As a swift action, you can shroud your arms in your chosen element for 1 round. Unarmed strikes with your arms or hands (or attacks with weapons held in those hands) deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of the appropriate type. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.
</div>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Esoteric</h4>
	Those with the power of esoteric dragons take aloofness to an extreme and are prone to long nights of sleep and vivid, enrapturing dreams. They are often deeply empathetic and emotional individuals, feeling the needs and wants of others intimately and, in some cases, more intensely than they can handle.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: As a standard action, you can project a psychic barrage at a creature within 15 feet to which you have line of sight. A creature targeted by your psychic barrage must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You can attempt a psychic barrage once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect.<br />
	<span class="bold">Special</span>: If you have 1 or more levels in a class that casts psychic spells, you can attempt a psychic barrage a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your level in that class (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.
</div>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Imperial</h4>
	Imperial dragons see themselves as masters of their respective domains, and those with heritages influenced by their legacies often have this same aggressively territorial nature. Individuals with this heritage tend to be charismatic, commanding, and proud people who have an unusual intensity.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: As a swift action, you emit an aura of command with a 10-foot radius for 1 round. Allies within your aura gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear. Enemies in your aura take a -2 penalty on Will saves against fear. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.
</div>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Metallic</h4>
	Metallic dragons leave an impression of kindness and hope in those infused with a portion of their power. Those who bear the blood of metallic dragons sometimes have iridescent hair of pale metallic hues and irises colored like polished metal.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you take this feat; the choice cannot be changed once made. As a swift action, you gain energy resistance 5 against your chosen element. This energy resistance lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.
</div>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Outer</h4>
	The utterly alien nature of outer dragons often conflicts with the more grounded and material upbringing of those who carry these dragons' influence within their bloodlines. Feelings of otherness or exclusion are common among humanoids with this bloodline, and many become exiles or wanderers.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: As a swift action, you can generate an alien aura around yourself with a 5-foot radius that lasts for 1 round. Any enemy who enters your aura must succeed at a Will save or become sickened for 1 round. A creature who successfully saves against your alien aura is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can generate an alien aura once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect.
</div>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Primal</h4>
	The scions with the power of the elementally attuned primal dragons are not often subtle in appearance. They tend towards hardy builds and skin tones that take on shimmering, iridescent hues in direct light. Additionally, they often experience tempestuous emotions that are difficult to control.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you take this feat; once made, this choice cannot be changed. As a standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius aura of elemental energy that lasts for 1 round. The area of this aura is considered difficult terrain, and creatures that end their turns in your aura take 1d6 points of energy damage of the appropriate type. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage but does not negate the difficult terrain effect. You can create an aura of elemental energy once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1).<br />
	<span class="bold">Special</span>: If you are a druid, hunter, or kineticist, you can create an elemental aura a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.
</div>
<h3 style="clear: both">Lesser Dragons</h3>
<p>Bloodlines infused with the power of lesser dragons are exceedingly rare, as such creatures lack both the means by which to take human form (and create a blood descendant), and the magical puissance to otherwise instill their legacy into a bloodline. On the world of Triaxus, dragonkin riders form supernatural bonds with their mounts that, in rare cases, affects the riders' children, allowing them to share in that draconic bond in a more physical manner. Other lesser draconic heritages are the result of binding dragon spirits to physical bloodlines and similar supernatural origins.</p>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Drake</h4>
	Creatures with drake ancestry are often swift-footed and have quick reflexes, mirroring the speed and grace of drakes. They tend to be wiry and athletic with long limbs and wild, untamed demeanors that thrive best beyond the boundaries of civilization. Befitting the variety of different drake breeds in the world, those with drake bloodlines often have hair or eye colors reminiscent of the scales of the drake breed to which they're related. Some might exhibit additional minor features suggestive of a specific draconic heritage, but such features provide no statistical benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: As a swift action, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.
</div>
<div class="box2">
	<h4>Linnorm</h4>
	The cursed blood of linnorms is a unique case, it is sometimes passed down by those who bear a child while under the effects of a linnorm's death curse. Such an unlikely offspring usually bears a visible mark or scar that ties her life to the legacy of that linnorm.<br />
	<span class="bold">Draconic Heritage</span>: As an immediate action when you are damaged by a melee attack, you can afflict your attacker with a curse. The target of your curse must succeed at a Will save or take a -2 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, and skill checks for 1 round. You can use this curse once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1).<br />
	<span class="bold">Special</span>: If you are a shaman or a witch, you can use this curse a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.

`<h3>Divine Fighting Techniques</h3>
<p>The following divine fighting techniques are available to all characters who take the Divine Fighting Technique feat, who worship the appropriate deity and give up the indicated class ability, or who meet the optional prerequisites.</p>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Abadar's Crossbow</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	Abadar teaches complex crossbow techniques.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: You can attempt a ranged steal combat maneuver check with a crossbow, using your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to calculate your Combat Maneuver Bonus. If you succeed, the stolen item is knocked away by the bolt; if the bolt can pierce any part of the item and the item weighs 2 pounds or less, the bolt continues past the creature and carries the item up to one range increment away, pinning it to whatever surface it lands on.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Rapid Reload; base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: When fighting a foe adjacent to a firm surface, you can attempt a ranged dirty trick combat maneuver check with a crossbow, using your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to calculate your Combat Maneuver Bonus. If you succeed, your bolt pins the target's clothing (or feathers, hide, or the like) to the surface, preventing the target from leaving that space until it breaks free by destroying the bolt or removing it with a successful Strength check (DC = the result of your combat maneuver check to pin it).
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Asmodeus's Mandate</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Although soldiers and mercenaries alike in Cheliax claim that the martial techniques detailed within <span class="italic">Wrath and Punishment</span>, the most well-known fighting manual of the Church of Asmodeus, are as old as time itself, martial experts across the Inner Sea region note that <span class="italic">Wrath and Punishment</span> is less than 3 decades old. Of course, few in Cheliax dare to publicly make such claims. Outside of Cheliax, copies of <span class="italic">Wrath and Punishment</span> tend to be found in Hellknight enclaves.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: Whenever you threaten a critical hit with a light mace or heavy mace on a foe, that foe becomes sickened for 1 round. If you confirm the critical hit, the sickened effect lasts for 2 rounds. The duration of the sickened effect doesn't stack with multiple critical threats.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Improved Feint; base attack bonus +10 or Bluff 10 ranks<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: An opponent that you hit with a light mace or heavy mace who is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC is also hindered by the attack. You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check as a swift action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity immediately after damage from the attack is resolved.
</div>

	<h4>Calistria's Poisoned Lash</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	Calistria inspires creative ways to poison foes.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A chaotic neutral rogue or slayer who worships Calistria can replace one talent with the following initial benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: You can apply poison (your choice) to a whip as a move action. You do not risk poisoning yourself when applying poison to a whip. A whip you wield can deliver contact poison upon a successful combat maneuver check as well as upon a successful attack roll, regardless of whether you deal damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Whip Mastery; base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A chaotic neutral rogue or slayer who worships Calistria can replace one advanced talent with the following advanced benefit even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: You can apply poison to a whip as a swift action. You can apply up to 3 doses of the same poison to a whip at a time. Foes are exposed to only 1 dose of poison from any one attack.

	<h4>Cayden Cailean's Blade and Tankard</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	Cayden Cailean is famous for wading into battle with a tankard in his off hand.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A chaotic good fighter or swashbuckler who worships Cayden Cailean can replace proficiency with shields or bucklers with the following initial benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: You can wield a tankard (or mug) as a weapon, treating it in all ways as a light mace appropriate for your size. If you engage in two-weapon fighting with a rapier or light weapon in one hand and a tankard in the other, you can drink a potion or other liquid from the tankard or attempt to toss liquid from the tankard as a dirty trick combat maneuver (such as to blind a foe) in place of attacking with it. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting a dirty trick maneuver with a tankard.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting; base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A chaotic good fighter or swashbuckler of at least 10th level who worships Cayden Cailean can replace a bonus feat or deed with the following advanced benefit, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: You can refill your tankard with a beverage, potion, or other liquid from a bottle or vial as a swift action. You gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to perform dirty tricks with tankards. The effects of such a dirty trick lasts for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which the result of your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD; a standard action is required for the target to remove this penalty.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Desna's Shooting Star</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Among the divine fighting manuals of the Inner Sea, few are as ancient as <span class="italic">Clamor of the Spheres</span>, a collection of fighting techniques favored by Desna's faithful. True to its name, the manual focuses on interpreting the chaos and sounds of combat, but nevertheless provides insightful and downright brilliant methods of defense with Desna's favored weapon, using techniques that treat a fight with a starknife more as a beautiful dance than a battle.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Prerequisite</span>: A chaotic good bard of at least 2nd level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following initial benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: You can add your Charisma bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls when wielding a starknife. If you do so, you don't modify attack rolls and damage rolls with your starknife with your Strength modifier, your Dexterity modifier (if you have Weapon Finesse), or any other ability score (if you have an ability that allows you to modify attack rolls and damage rolls with that ability score).<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Dex 17; Rapid Shot; base attack bonus +11 or Sleight of Hand 11 ranks<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Advanced Prerequisite</span>: A chaotic good bard of at least 10th level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: You can impart a powerful spin to a thrown starknife so that multiple blades strike the target rather than just a single blade of the four, dealing extra damage with the other blades. As a full-round action, you can make a single attack with a thrown starknife, rolling 1d4 to determine how many effective strikes you gain with the attack (if you roll a 1, then only one blade strikes). If the attack hits, all of the effective strikes damage the target. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. The damage bonus from your appropriate ability score modifier applies to each strike, as do other damage bonuses, such as a bard's inspire competence bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each strike.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Erastil's Distracting Shot</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Sometimes used as a companion piece to the <span class="italic">Parables of Erastil</span>, the lesser-known <span class="italic">Horns of the Elk</span> is a manual completely dedicated to archery. Lacking the folktales that the <span class="italic">Parables</span> are celebrated for, the <span class="italic">Horns of the Elk</span> instead focuses on covering a wide array of beginner and advanced archery tactics. A copy of the manual can be found virtually anywhere a shrine to Erastil exists.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Prerequisite</span>: A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil can choose Divine Fighting Technique as the bonus feat granted by his combat style if he chooses archery as his combat style.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: As a standard action, you can fire a distracting shot from your longbow or shortbow; when you do, select one ally who is adjacent to the creature you are targeting with the distracting shot. If you hit the creature, the chosen ally gains a +2 bonus to her Armor Class against that creature. This bonus to her Armor Class lasts until the start of your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Dex 17; Precise Shot; base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Advanced Prerequisite</span>: A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace the bonus feat granted by his combat style at 10th level with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: When you fire a distracting shot at a creature and hit the creature, you grant a +4 Armor Class bonus to the selected adjacent ally and a +2 Armor Class bonus to all other allies within 30 feet of the selected adjacent ally against attacks by the targeted creature.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Gorum's Swordsmanship</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	Gorum teaches devastating greatsword techniques.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following initial benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: If you have the Vital Strike feat, you can apply its effect to an attack you make with a greatsword at the end of a charge. If you don't have the Vital Strike feat, that attack deals 1 additional point of damage instead. The first time you make an attack of opportunity with a greatsword after using Vital Strike with a greatsword on your turn, you can apply Vital Strike to that attack of opportunity.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Cleave; Vital Strike; base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacemente</span>: A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter of at least 10th level who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: When you use Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike with a greatsword, the damage counts as continuous damage from an injury for the purpose of determining whether a target must attempt a concentration check to cast spells.
</div>

	<h4>Iomedae's Inspiring Sword</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	Iomedae demonstrates how to turn a longsword into a shining beacon of hope.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A paladin who worships Iomedae can replace a mercy with this initial benefit, even if she doesn't meets its prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: While wielding a longsword, you can perform an impressive display of prowess as a full-round action. All allies within 30 feet who can see your display gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round + 1 round per 5 points of base attack bonus you have.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Dazzling Display; Weapon Focus (longsword); base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Replacement</span>: A paladin of at least 9th level who worships Iomedae can replace a mercy with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn't meet the benefit's prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: As a standard action or at the end of a charge, you can make an attack against a foe with a longsword. If you succeed, you grant all allies who can see your attack a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute.

	<h4>Irori's Perfected Fist</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Practically synonymous with Irori and his faith, <span class="italic">The Woven Fist</span> is among the best known of all diving fighting manuals. Many learned monks were taught their first martial techniques using drills and regiments from this manual, which some claim was written by Irori's own hand before his ascension to divinity. Although most commonly found in temples to Irori and secluded monasteries, copies of <span class="italic">The Woven Fist</span> often make their way into less scrupulous hands because of their effectiveness.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Prerequisite</span>: A lawful neutral brawler or monk can replace a bonus feat with the following initial benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: You can take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes in order to deal the average amount of damage with each successful attack instead of rolling your weapon damage. For instance, if your unarmed strike would normally deal 1d4 points of weapon damage, you instead deal 2 points of weapon damage. Apply bonuses and modifiers to this result as if you had rolled your damage normally. You must choose to use this benefit before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. You do not average additional damage dice (such as those granted by a sneak attack) when using this ability.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Critical Focus; Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); monk level 10th or base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Advanced Prerequisite</span>: A lawful neutral brawler or monk of at least 10th level who worships Irori and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace a bonus feat with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: You no longer take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with your unarmed strikes when you choose to deal the average amount of damage. If you critically hit a creature when using this ability, you automatically inflict maximum weapon damage for that critical hit (although you must still roll sneak attack dice or any other dice-based additional damage).

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Lamashtu's Carving</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	One of the grisliest divine fighting manuals is <span class="italic">Fecundity of Corpses</span>, a harrowing tome that depicts the fighting styles favored by the followers of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. In addition to detailing many of the more gruesome rites favored by the Demon Queen, <span class="italic">Fecundity of Corpses</span> includes hundreds of techniques recorded in blood by cultists of Lamashtu from across the Inner Sea region. Though no standardized edition of this manual exists because of the cult's discordant hierarchy, each tome manages to perfectly capture similar techniques for sowing fear and blood in Lamashtu's name.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: As a standard action, you can make a single attack with a falchion or a kukri in order to deal bleed damage to the target. When you make this attack, you do not apply your ability modifier (normally Strength, but potentially other modifiers) to the hit point damage dealt by your attack; instead, add an amount of bleed damage equal to this modifier. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or any amount of magical healing. Bleed damage from this benefit doesn't stack with itself.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Dazing Assault<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Advanced Prerequisite</span>: <br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: Whenever you hit a bleeding creature with a melee attack using a falchion or a kukri, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or become staggered for 1 round. Multiple attacks do not cause this condition to stack, and a creature that successfully saves against this staggering effect is immune to this effect for 1 round.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Norgober's Silent Shiv</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Entombed within a volume known as <span class="italic">The Reaper's Hand</span>, the divine fighting techniques of Norgorber are among the most elusive in the Inner Sea region, but are theorized to cover the techniques that acolytes of Father Skinsaw use to move and strike unseen. Copies of this manual are rare, and those who spill its secrets to anyone unworthy often meet a swift and bloody end at the hands of the faith's inquisitors.<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Prerequisite</span>: A neutral evil rogue of at least 2nd level who worships Norgorber can replace a rogue talent with the following initial benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: Whenever you attack an opponent that is completely unaware of your presence (such as when you are using the Stealth skill or invisible), your attack deals damage as if you were one size category larger. This benefit applies only to the first attack that you make against the target, and only with attacks made with light or one-handed weapons intended for creatures of your size (including thrown attacks).<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Stealth 10 ranks<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Advanced Prerequisite</span>: A neutral evil rogue of at least 10th level who worships Norgorber can replace an advanced rogue talent with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: At the start of each round, choose one opponent that you can see and attempt a Stealth check as a swift action. If the result of your check exceeds the target's CMD, treat the target as if it were completely unaware of your presence for the purpose of the initial benefit of this divine fighting technique. If you beat the target's CMD by 5 or more, you also treat it as being completely unaware of your presence for the purposes of all class features and feats you have.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Rovagug's Thunder</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Most copies of <span class="italic">Ravage and Ruin</span>, the divine fighting manual of the Rough Beast Rovagug, are scrawled in blood upon flensed skins by orc priests; and indeed the vile techniques described within originated from the Hold of Belkzen not long after the orcs first seized that land as their own. Reviled across the Inner Sea, <span class="italic">Ravage and Ruin</span> sees additional use among savage Ulfen clans who have fallen to the Rough Beast's urges to become corrupt, lunatic cannibals who relish despoiling beauty in Rovagug's name.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: Whenever you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent, you deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. In addition, whenever your dirty trick combat maneuver check beats an opponent's CMD by 5 or more, you can forgo increasing the duration of your condition by 1 or more rounds to instead impose a -2 penalty on all of that opponent's Charisma-based checks. This penalty doesn't stack with itself, and it lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 minute) or until the target receives any form of magical healing.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Power Attack; base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Optional Advanced Prerequisite</span>: A chaotic evil barbarian of at least 10th level who worships Rovagug can replace a rage power with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: Anytime you use Power Attack with a great axe or a natural attack, you ignore an amount of the target's hardness or damage reduction equal to the penalty Power Attack imparts to your attack roll. This benefit stacks with Penetrating Strike and Greater Penetrating Strike.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Sarenrae's Mercy</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Although the Dawnflower is the goddess of healing and redemption, she is not a goddess of peace, and her followers are taught that combat may be the only way to ensure the safety of those who look to the faith for protection. In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of <span class="italic">Dawnflower's Mercies</span> teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae's arms.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a scimitar to deal nonlethal damage. If your attack with the scimitar would normally deal additional damage (such as via sneak attack, the <span class="italic">flaming</span> weapon special ability, or the like), this additional damage can be nonlethal damage. You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and inflict spells so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead. You can choose to apply this effect as the spell is cast.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Great Fortitude; Weapon Focus (scimitar); Heal 10 ranks<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: Once per round as you strike a foe with a weapon and deal nonlethal damage with that attack, you regain 1d6 hit points as the warmth of Sarenrae's approval and the conviction that you are doing the right thing to minimize suffering infuses your body and soul. If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points. You can gain the benefit of this healing only once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks you make with the weapon.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Torag's Patient Strikes</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	Copies of <span class="italic">Lessons of the Father</span>, the divine fighting manual of Torag, are somewhat rare outside of the Five Kings Mountains, as tradition mandates that all copies of <span class="italic">Lessons of the Father</span> must be scribed by hand in Dwarven on iron sheets and bound between slabs of stone hand-carved by a cleric of Torag. As a result, these tomes are somewhat cumbersome to transport (even the smallest copy of the book weighs 50 pounds, and most exceed 100 pounds in weight). Those who have mastered the <span class="italic">Lessons of the Father</span> are highly respected within the faith.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: Whenever you wield a warhammer, add your Wisdom bonus to the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make per round. These additional attacks of opportunity don't stack with those granted by Combat Reflexes, but this benefit counts as Combat Reflexes for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements. In addition, you can make attacks of opportunity while you're flat-footed.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Vital Strike; Weapon Focus (warhammer); base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: Once per round, before you make an attack of opportunity with a warhammer, you can declare an opportunistic strike. If the attack hits, you can apply the effects of your Vital Strike feat. You can apply the Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike feat instead if you have either of those feats. If you confirm a critical hit with an opportunistic strike, you can attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. This combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Urgathoa's Hunger</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Divine Anthology</span></p>
	The grisly content of <span class="italic">Pallid Cravings</span> can be found in many places where the Pallid Princess maintains a significant presence, especially within the undead nation of Geb. The pages of this manuscript are said to be tattooed onto a humanoid and flensed off while the victim is still alive; the swaths of skin are then carefully preserved for presentation in the book. <span class="italic">Pallid Cravings</span> details hundreds of ways for a member of Urgathoa's faithful to satisfy her depraved urges for an opponent's flesh and blood while in battle.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can feast upon the life essence of a creature that you hit with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action. When you do so, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the scythe attack. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute and don't stack.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Heal 10 ranks; base attack bonus +7<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can exacerbate any lingering contagions within a target's body upon making a successful melee attack with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action, and causes the target to immediately attempt additional saving throws against all diseases with which it is currently afflicted. Any failed saves cause the target to immediately take the effects of that disease, while a successful save does not count toward the number of consecutive saves that the target must succeed at in order to cure the disease.

	<h4>Zon-Kuthon's Flensing</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	Zon-Kuthon invites all mortals to join in inflicting and suffering pain.<br />
	<span class="bold">Initial Benefit</span>: Once per round, when you hit a foe with a spiked chain, you can twist the chain so it painfully flenses both of you. You and your target are both sickened for 1 round, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be sickened for an additional 1d4+1 rounds.<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Prerequisites</span>: Base attack bonus +10<br />
	<span class="bold">Advanced Benefit</span>: Whenever you sicken a foe with pain using a spiked chain (whether by flensing, as a dirty trick combat maneuver, or otherwise), the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be nauseated for the first round of the duration.

// 50: Soul-Powered Magic
`<h3>The Value of Souls</h3>
<p>Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Life Force</span>: A soul's life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested &times; 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature's soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Age</span>: A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Flavor</span>: As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of Desna might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way.</p>`,

	<span class="bold">Counterweight (Climb 5 ranks)</span>: You can use your anvil as a counterweight when you climb a rope or chain to reduce your Climb DC by 5.<br />
	<span class="bold">Improve Armor (Craft [armor] 5 ranks)</span>: You can spend an hour with your anvil and a suit of nonmagical metal armor to temporarily increase the armor's armor bonus by 1. This bonus ends after the next time the wearer is hit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Quick Fix (Craft [any] 5 ranks)</span>: You can spend 1 minute with your anvil and a metal item with the broken condition to remove the broken condition from the item for 1 hour. The item does not recover any hit points, and at the end of the hour it regains the broken condition and loses an additional 1d6 hit points (unless properly fixed by then).<br />
	<span class="bold">Smash Through (Improved Bull Rush)</span>: When you end your move adjacent to a closed door, you can open the door as part of your move action (instead of as a separate move action) by smashing it with an anvil as you move. If the door is stuck or locked, you must succeed at a bull rush combat maneuver check that exceeds the door's break DC.

	<h4>Boot Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Dirty Tactics Toolbox</span></p>
	A pair of boots refers to any set of footwear that has hard soles. These equipment tricks can be used with either magic or mundane boots.<br />
	<span class="bold">Cleat Stomp (Improved Unarmed Strike)</span>: When you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent while wearing a pair of boots with cleats, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or by magical healing. The effects of this trick stack with other sources of bleed damage but not with other bleed damage dealt by this trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Heel Crush (Improved Dirty Trick)</span>: When you succeed at a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent within melee range, you can crush the target's foot or similar appendage with your boot heel. Instead of inflicting one of the conditions that can normally be imposed by a dirty trick, you reduce the target's movement speed by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). You can't use a dirty trick combat maneuver in this manner against an opponent that is using a movement type other than its land speed, and movement types other than land speeds aren't affected by this equipment trick. As usual, a creature with a movement speed of 5 feet can't take a 5-foot step.<br />
	<span class="bold">Sharp Veer (Combat Reflexes)</span>: Whenever you use the charge or run action, you can make one 90-degree turn during your movement. You must move at least 10 feet in a straight line after this turn if you are charging.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Cloak Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Dirty Tactics Toolbox</span></p>
	At the GM's discretion, you can use these tricks with any cloth object that is roughly the same size and shape as a cloak for a creature of your size (such as a curtain).<br />
	<span class="bold">Dazzling Trail (Dazzling Display)</span>: When you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize an opponent while wearing a cloak, you can increase the duration of the demoralize effect by 1d4 rounds.<br />
	<span class="bold">Distracting Cloak (Stealth 3 ranks)</span>: When you attempt a Bluff check to feint, you can use your cape to create a diversion instead of denying your opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC. Compare the result of your Bluff check against the feint DC of each opponent that can see you (DC = 10 + the opponent's base attack bonus + the opponent's Wisdom modifier, or 10 + the opponent's Sense Motive bonus if he is trained in Sense Motive and this bonus is higher). You can attempt a Stealth check to hide from any opponent that you successfully feint against in this manner, even if that opponent is observing you. If you do not have cover or concealment against any of these targets at the start of each of their turns, they automatically spot you at that time.<br />
	<span class="bold">Parachute Cloak (Acrobatics 5 ranks)</span>: While wearing a cloak, you can adjust your grip so that it catches the air as you fall. If you use both of your hands to hold on to your cloak as you fall, you can attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to ignore the first 20 feet fallen (as opposed to the usual DC 15 check to ignore only the first 10 feet), and you avoid falling prone at the end of your jump even if you take damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Suerte de Capote (Dueling Cape)</span>: While using the Dueling Cape feat to wield a cloak or similar object as a buckler, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint in combat. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 ranks in Sleight of Hand that you possess. Additionally, you can release your cape as a free action whenever you successfully feint an opponent with a melee attack to entangle it, as detailed in the Dueling Cape feat.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Heavy Blade Scabbard Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory</span></p>
	In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (heavy blade scabbard) feat to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any sword scabbard designed for a heavy blade (see the fighter weapon groups). At your GM's discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a scabbard intended for a light blade, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat and may be less effective.<br />
	<span class="bold">Capture Weapon (Improved Disarm)</span>: When you successfully disarm an opponent's manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a -4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM's discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard.<br />
	<span class="bold">Find the Hidden (Blind-Fight)</span>: You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a -2 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn).<br />
	<span class="bold">Grab Purchase (Climb 5 ranks)</span>: You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Hurl Scabbard (Quick Draw)</span>: You can draw your weapon in such a way t hat you send your combat scabbard whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon.<br />
	<span class="bold">Steer Opponent (Improved Bull Rush)</span>: You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Tangle Leg (Improved Trip, Throw Anything)</span>: When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent's legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Instrument Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Bards and other musicians must sometimes improvise more than their music. These instrument tricks expand any musical instrument's uses and supplement the Equipment Trick feat. Some tricks might be unusable for certain instruments at the GM's discretion; for example, an organ is too unwieldy to use as an improvised weapon. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (instrument) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Attention Grabber (Perform 5 ranks, Bluff 5 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature)</span>: Your loud or discordant performance covers your allies' movements. Creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you play an instrument take a -2 penalty on Perception checks, other than Perception checks made in response to your actions, for as long as you play.<br />
	<span class="bold">Goad Animal (Handle Animal 5 ranks or Animal Affinity)</span>: You can use your soothing performance to handle an animal that is friendly toward you, such as a mount or pet. When playing your instrument, commanding the animal to perform a trick it knows is a free action, and pushing it to perform a trick it does not know is a standard action. If you already can make an animal respond more quickly, such as with the link ability of an animal companion, this trick provides no benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Jaw-Dropping Distraction (Perform 7 ranks, Bluff 7 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature)</span>: When using your instrument, you can attempt a Perform check instead of a Bluff check to feint an opponent. If you succeed, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against one target of your choosing (other than you) until the beginning of your next turn. Once you have used this trick against a creature, whether or not you succeeded at the check, you cannot use this trick to feint the creature for 24 hours. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to this trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Play to the Crowd (Perform 3 ranks, Diplomacy 3 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature)</span>: You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC's initial attitude toward you as long as you are able to perform for at least 1 minute. You cannot use this trick to increase the NPC's attitude beyond friendly.<br />
	<span class="bold">Ruffian's Riff (Catch Off-Guard)</span>: You can treat a musical instrument as an improvised weapon with the performance special feature. When you use a masterwork musical instrument as an improvised weapon, you treat it as a masterwork weapon (adding a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls). Your attacks with a magical musical instrument are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Kaava Musk Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Sargava, the Lost Colony</span></p>
	In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you normally must have the Equipment Trick (Kaava musk) feat to use a trick. You can, however, attempt Kaava musk tricks marked with an asterisk without the Equipment Trick (Kaava musk) feat, but you have a 50% chance of splashing yourself with the musk instead of completing the trick; this failure uses the dose of the musk (and in most cases invalidates what you were planning to use the musk for).<br />
	<span class="bold">Careful Steps (Nimble Moves or Acrobatics 5 ranks)</span>: You can pass through a square splashed with Kaava musk without getting any of it on you.<br />
	<span class="bold">Fast Flask (Quick Draw)</span>: You can draw an easily accessible flask of Kaava musk as a free action rather than a standard action.<br />
	<span class="bold">Make the Kill (scent ability or scent rage power)</span>: You gain a +1 morale bonus on weapon attack and weapon damage rolls when attacking a target marked with Kaava musk.<br />
	<span class="bold">Musk Blinding (Blinding Critical)</span>: When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the Fortitude save DC of the blinding critical effect by +5.<br />
	<span class="bold">Musk Poison (poison use class ability)*</span>: You can apply Kaava musk to a melee or thrown weapon as if it were a poison. This makes your weapon reek in the normal manner. However, the first creature struck by your weapon also gains the musk-stink as if it were splashed by a full container of musk 2 days ago. The struck target can wash off the musk on the next round in the normal manner, but otherwise it continues to stink for 2 more days. Kaava musk applied to small items like ammunition has no effect.<br />
	<span class="bold">Musk Sickening (Sickening Critical)</span>: When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the duration of the sickening critical effect by 1 minute.<br />
	<span class="bold">Reactive Splashing (Improved Disarm)*</span>: When disarming an opponent of a flask of Kaava musk, you can have the flask break at your opponent's feet, automatically splashing him with the musk.<br />
	<span class="bold">Splashproof Shield (Shield Focus)</span>: If you are using a shield and are hit with Kaava musk, you can make a Reflex save to use the shield to prevent any of the musk from touching you (thus, if you drop the shield, you do not have any of the musk penalties). The DC for this ability is 10 if using a tower shield, 15 for a heavy shield, 20 for a light shield, and 25 for a buckler. You cannot use this trick if you are flat-footed or helpless.<br />
	<span class="bold">Stink-Fighting (Blind-Fight)</span>: Your familiarity with Kaava musk allows you to pinpoint an invisible musk-marked creature with a Perception check at only a -10 penalty rather than the normal -20 penalty.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Ladder Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Ladders are not a common adventuring staple due to their cumbersome size. Yet some adventurers who take ladders with them into the field use them to great effect. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (ladder) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Guarding Ladder (Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes)</span>: You can hold a ladder in one hand and treat it as a heavy wooden shield with the fragile special feature. While holding a ladder, you can use the aid another action (or related abilities, such as the Bodyguard feat) to improve the AC of an ally up to 10 feet away.<br />
	<span class="bold">Ladder Fighter (Catch Off-Guard)</span>: You treat a ladder as a quarterstaff with the fragile and trip special features, and you can apply feats and abilities as if it were a quarterstaff (for example, a monk can use a ladder to perform a flurry of blows).<br />
	<span class="bold">Ladder Lock (Improved Dirty Trick)</span>: When you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against an adjacent opponent while you are holding a ladder, you can trap your target's limbs between the rungs of the ladder. Your target gains the entangled condition in addition to the normal condition imposed by your dirty trick, and for the same duration. If the target removes the other condition, it also removes the entangled condition, and vice versa.<br />
	<span class="bold">Vaulting Ladder (Acrobatics 3 ranks, Climb 3 ranks, or Acrobatic)</span>: You can climb the length of a ladder as part of a running jump, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus on your Acrobatics check and adding the ladder's length to the total distance you travel with your jump. You must let go of the ladder when you jump.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Lantern Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Lanterns come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Each of these tricks can be performed with any sort of lantern or lamp, except when a specific kind of lamp is indicated in the description. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (lantern) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Intensified Oil (Craft [alchemy] 3 ranks)</span>: You can combine three flasks of oil into a single use of improved oil as you add it to a lamp or lantern. This improved oil causes the lamp or lantern to which it is added to burn more brightly than usual, increasing its light range by 50%. This improved oil can only be used in the lamp or lantern it's mixed in and has no additional special effects.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lantern Bash (Shield Focus)</span>: If you carry a lamp or lantern in the hand you use to wield a light shield, your shield bash attacks with that shield deal an additional 1 point of fire damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lantern Bomb (Quick Draw)</span>: You can throw a lamp or lantern with at least 4 hours of oil remaining in it as a splash weapon, using the rules for alchemist's fire.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lesser Light (no additional prerequisites)</span>: When lighting a lamp or lantern, you reduce the size of its flame to provide only dim light in the area in which the lantern usually provides normal light. The lamp or lantern uses oil at half the usual rate. The lamp or lantern must be extinguished and re-lit to shed light normally.<br />
	<span class="bold">Oil Splash (Improved Dirty Trick)</span>: You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent while either you or the opponent is holding a lamp or lantern. If you succeed at this combat maneuver check, you can knock some oil from the lamp or lantern into your target's face. Your target is blinded as normal by the dirty trick and takes 1 point of fire damage each round the blindness lasts.

<div class="box1">
	<h4>Mirror Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Adventurers carry mirrors for many unconventional uses. You may perform the following tricks with a mirror or, at the GM's discretion, with a similarly reflective handheld item, such as a highly polished piece of metal. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (mirror) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Blinding Light (Sleight of Hand 3 ranks)</span>: When in an area of normal or bright light, you can use a mirror held in your hand to shine light into the eyes of a creature within 10 feet as a move action. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your ranks in Sleight of Hand) or be dazzled for 1 round.<br />
	<span class="bold">Bold Presentation (Knowledge [religion] 5 ranks)</span>: You can use a move action (rather than a standard action) to use a mirror to hold at bay a creature susceptible to mirrors (such as a vampire).<br />
	<span class="bold">Reflect Gaze (Combat Reflexes)</span>: As an immediate or swift action, you can use a mirror to reflect a gaze attack. You must either be looking at the creature with the gaze attack or averting your eyes to use this ability, and you must succeed at your saving throw to resist the creature's gaze attack (if you don't avoid the need to attempt a saving throw by averting your eyes). If you reflect the creature's gaze back at it, the creature must succeed at a saving throw to resist its own gaze or lose access to its gaze attack for 1 round. If the creature attempts to gaze at you with its attack action, you may attempt to reflect its gaze back at it, as above, or redirect its gaze to a new target within 30 feet of you. In this case, the new creature is treated as the target of the original gaze (unless it is blindfolded or otherwise unable to see), although it is automatically treated as if it is averting its eyes.<br />
	<span class="bold">Telltale Reflection (Spellcraft 3 ranks or racial bonus on saving throws against illusion spells and effects)</span>: You are familiar with the ways illusions don't precisely mimic natural objects when reflected. If you see an illusion within 10 feet reflected in a mirror, you count as having studied it carefully for the purposes of attempting a saving throw to disbelieve it.<br />
	<span class="bold">Trickster's Mirror (Spell Focus [illusion])</span>: You can use a mirror worth at least 10 gp as an additional material component for an illusion (figment) spell. The spell is treated as 1 spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Net Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Dirty Tactics Toolbox</span></p>
	To use any of these equipment tricks, you must be proficient with nets.<br />
	<span class="bold">Binding Trick (Improved Dirty Trick)</span>: When you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against a target entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, the target cannot take an action to remove the condition imposed by the dirty trick until it escapes from or bursts free of the net.<br />
	<span class="bold">Grappling Net (Improved Grapple)</span>: When you attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against a foe entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, you do not take a penalty on the grapple combat maneuver check for not having two hands free, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. If you successfully pin the target while it is still entangled by the net, you can use the net to tie up the target as a swift action.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Pole Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Each of these tricks can be done with a pole or balancing pole, but specific poles have further abilities. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (pole) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Pole Trip (Catch Off-Guard or Improved Trip)</span>: You can treat a pole as an improvised weapon with the reach and trip special features. You can treat an unhinged folding pole as an improvised weapon with the disarm and trip special features. A pole or folding pole used as an improvised weapon deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Seek the Unseen (Perception 1 rank)</span>: When you attempt to find a creature you cannot see (either because it is invisible, or because you are blind), you can sweep a pole through any two adjacent squares within 10 feet of you as a standard action. Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature's current location.<br />
	<span class="bold">Wall Climb (Climb 3 ranks)</span>: You can climb narrow passageways if your pole can reach a wall or other solid surface on both sides, bracing yourself and scooting the pole further along the surface as you climb. This method is reliable but laborious; you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Climb checks to climb in this manner, but you climb at half the usual speed.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Rope Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Pathfinder Society Field Guide</span></p>
	In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (rope) feat to use rope tricks. Rope tricks can be performed with hemp rope or silk rope, or with similar ropelike items at the GM's discretion.<br />
	<span class="bold">Coil (Sleight of Hand 5 ranks)</span>: You can coil rope rapidly, requiring only 1 round to coil 20 feet of rope. (Coiling 20 feet of rope normally takes 1d6 rounds.)<br />
	<span class="bold">Hogtie (Improved Grapple)</span>: When you attempt to tie up an opponent you are grappling, your penalty is only -5 instead of the normal -10.<br />
	<span class="bold">Knotted Weapon (Weapon Proficiency [spiked chain])</span>: You can use a knotted length of rope as a spiked chain that inflicts bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lash (Weapon Proficiency [whip])</span>: You can use a length of rope as a whip at no penalty. The piece of rope that is used as a whip must be 10 feet long; length in excess of this must remain coiled or otherwise unused at your feet or side.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lifeline (Climb 5 ranks)</span>: When you or a nearby creature is falling (from a failed Climb check or otherwise), you can throw a held rope as an immediate action, maintaining a grip on one end. If you are falling, this is treated as an attempt to catch yourself while falling made with a +10 bonus, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around. When attempting this check on another creature, treat it as if you yourself were falling. If the weight of the creature exceeds twice your heavy load limit (your own equipment does not count against this maximum), you are pulled after it.<br />
	<span class="bold">Quick Release (no additional prerequisites)</span>: You can secure a rope such that you can loose it from either end by making a quick series of tugs (a move action) at any point along the rope's length.<br />
	<span class="bold">Slip Away (Escape Artist 5 ranks)</span>: You gain a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from ropes and ropelike restraints (such as vines).<br />
	<span class="bold">Tangle (Throw Anything)</span>: You can throw a coiled length of rope as a ranged weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the target becomes entangled. It can cut or burst the rope, or escape with a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The rope must be unsecured to use this trick.
</div>
<div class="box1">
	<h4>Shield Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory</span></p>
	In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (shield) feat and proficiency in (non-tower) shields to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any light or heavy shield. At your GM's discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tower shield or buckler, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat for that kind of shield and may add a penalty on the associated roll.<br />
	<span class="bold">Break Ground (Improved Trip, Throw Anything)</span>: In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent's feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square.<br />
	<span class="bold">Hurl Shield (Throw Anything)</span>: You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Little Wall (Escape Artist 5 ranks)</span>: You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC.<br />
	<span class="bold">Keen Eye (Perception 5 ranks)</span>: You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield's AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature's gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.<br />
	<span class="bold">Release Shield (no prerequisites)</span>: You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield as a free action. Once you've removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.<br />
	<span class="bold">Ricochet Shield (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything)</span>: When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.<br />
	<span class="bold">Shield Gag (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything)</span>: You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouth-based abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition and return to your own squares, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature.<br />While the shield is in place, the monster cannot use its mouth to make attacks (such as a bite or a giant frog's sticky tongue) against anything but the shield and cannot speak clearly enough to cast spells or use items requiring speech. If it uses a breath weapon, its range is half normal and any damage dealt must first get through the shield, with any remaining damage affecting the area normally.

	<h4>Sling Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Heroes from the Fringe</span></p>
	The following sling tricks are commonly used by those trained in the art of the sling. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (sling) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Charging Snare (Improved Trip)</span>: You can dash toward an opponent and use your sling to trip it up. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed at a foe and attempt a trip combat maneuver. This movement follows the rules of movement during a charge. You gain a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check, and you take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your second turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Disarming Lash (Improved Disarm)</span>: You can lash out with your sling to ensnare an opponent's weapon and pull it away. When you perform a disarm combat maneuver while wielding a sling, you can use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to determine your CMB.<br />
	<span class="bold">Hurl Splash Weapon (Far Shot, Throw Anything)</span>: You can fling a splash weapon with your sling to great effect. As a full-round action, you can use your sling to hurl a splash weapon as a ranged touch attack with a range equal to half your sling's range. This trick does not work with an alchemist's bombs.<br />
	<span class="bold">Pouch Bandage (Heal 5 ranks)</span>: You can rapidly wrap your sling around an ally's wound, stanching the flow of blood. When you or an ally within your reach has the bleed condition, as a standard action, you can bind the wound, stopping the bleed damage from one bleed effect; any other bleed effects still deal their bleed damage.

	<h4>Smokestick Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Often overlooked for alchemist's fire, smokesticks can provide versatile tactical advantage in the right hands. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (smokestick) feat to use the following trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Choking Smoke (Improved Dirty Trick)</span>: When you perform a successful dirty trick combat maneuver while holding a lit smokestick, you can shove the smokestick into your opponent's mouth (or other breathing apparatus) to impair its breathing. The affected creature begins choking and sputtering, gaining the sickened condition. Unlike a normal dirty trick, the foe must succeed at a Fortitude save to remove this condition, in addition to spending an action. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + half your base attack bonus + any bonus you add to dirty trick combat maneuvers (such as that granted by Improved Dirty Trick). This condition ends after 1 minute, if not removed sooner. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this effect.<br />
	<span class="bold">Slow Burn (Craft [alchemy] 1 rank)</span>: You can burn a smokestick just slowly enough to not consume it immediately. You must choose to use this trick when you light a smokestick. A slow-burning smokestick is not consumed after 1 round, and the smoke produced only lasts for 1 round. For the next hour, as a swift action when you are holding a slow-burning smokestick, you can use the smokestick to produce a cloud of smoke that lasts for only 1 round. The slow-burning smokestick lasts for 1 hour or until you have created a total of 10 clouds, at which point it is consumed.<br />
	<span class="bold">Smoke Shadow (Craft [alchemy] 1 rank; Skill Focus [Stealth] or Stealthy)</span>: You can use a slow-burning smokestick (using the slow burn trick) to conceal your motions while sneaking. While your smokestick is slow-burning, whenever a creature would succeed at an opposed Perception check against your Stealth check, you can emit a puff of smoke as an immediate action to hide your presence. When you do, the creature must reroll its Perception check and take the second result, even if it is worse. Even if the creature fails this Perception check, it is aware of your general location because of the sudden smoke (unless the location is already filled with smoke, like that emitted by the normal use of a smokestick, or fog).<br />
	<span class="bold">Smoke Strike (Craft [alchemy] 1 rank, Improved Feint)</span>: You can use a slow-burning smokestick (using the slow burn trick) to distract foes from your strikes. As a swift action when you are holding a slow-burning smokestick, instead of producing a cloud with the slow burn trick, you can create a small, dense burst of smoke in an adjacent foe's face. This allows you to feint as part of that swift action.

	<h4>Sunrod Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Pathfinder Society Field Guide</span></p>
	In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (sunrod) feat to use a trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Flare (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks or alchemist bomb class feature)</span>: As a standard action, you can expend the remaining life of a sunrod (lit or unlit) in an instant. Sighted creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a -2 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it flares as describe above. Since you don't have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.<br />
	<span class="bold">Fast Sunrod (Quick Draw)</span>: You can draw and light an easily accessible sunrod from a pack as a swift action.<br />
	<span class="bold">Like the Sun (ability to cast any spell with the light descriptor)</span>: You can use a sunrod as an additional material component for any spell that bears the light descriptor. The spell is treated as one spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs and its ability to overcome sources of magical darkness.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lodge Sunrod (Throw Anything)</span>: You can throw your sunrod as a ranged improvised weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the sunrod does no damage, but stays lodged on the target until the target or another creature spends a move action to remove it.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lure (Handle Animal 5 ranks)</span>: As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animal's CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animal's maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Twice as Brightly (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks)</span>: As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light). It does not increase the light level in bright light.

	<h4>Tanglefoot Bag Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	Tanglefoot bags can be a versatile and even deadly tool in the hands of a skilled user. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (tanglefoot bag) feat to use a trick. At your GM's discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tangleburn bag, but at the risk of dealing fire damage to connected items or creatures.<br />
	<span class="bold">Captivating Embrace (Improved Grapple)</span>: You get up close and personal, then use a tanglefoot bag to keep things that way. When you successfully grapple a creature, you burst a tanglefoot bag to stick yourself to your target. You must have the tanglefoot bag in hand to use this ability unless you have the Quick Draw feat (in which case the tanglefoot bag must be easily accessible on your person). While the tanglefoot bag's effect lasts, you do not take a penalty to grapple checks for not having two hands free, and your opponent takes a -4 penalty on combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to break the grapple.<br />
	<span class="bold">Sticky Bombs (Quick Draw, Throw Anything)</span>: You can slap another item on a tanglefoot bag and toss both to ensure contact. When you throw an alchemical item, you can attach a tanglefoot bag to it as you throw it; this does not require an additional action. On a hit, the target is affected by the tanglefoot bag, with the alchemical item firmly stuck in the goo. The item stays in the target's square as long the tanglefoot bag's effect lasts, making this most useful with items that don't immediately take effect, such as darkflares (see above) or fuse grenades.<br />
	<span class="bold">Thieving Shield (Shield Focus or armor training class feature)</span>: As an immediate action, you can splatter a tanglefoot bag on your shield, making it sticky. Your shield gains the grapple weapon quality when used as a weapon with a shield bash attack. In addition, the first time each round an attack with a manufactured weapon misses you by 4 or less, you can make a free disarm attempt against that weapon. This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Your shield remains sticky for 2d4 rounds, after which it must be cleaned (a full-round action) before you can use this trick again.

	<h4>Thieves' Tools Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Dirty Tactics Toolbox</span></p>
	Indispensable to a rogue or any other adventurer who wishes to crack open a lock or disable a trap, a set of thieves' tools contains a number of sharp picks and coarse files.<br />
	<span class="bold">Dirty Pick (Disable Device 1 rank)</span>: You don't take any penalties for using a set of thieves' tools as an improvised melee weapon. A set of thieves' tools used as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of piercing damage. Additionally, when you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check to impose the blinded condition with a set of thieves' tools, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity. Masterwork thieves' tools grant a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks for these purposes.<br />
	<span class="bold">Let Myself In (Knowledge [engineering] 3 ranks)</span>: Whenever you succeed at a Disable Device check to unlock an object that requires a move action to open, such as a door, you can immediately open that object as a free action instead.<br />
	<span class="bold">Ranged Chicanery (Disable Device 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, ability to cast <span class="italic">mage hand</span>)</span>: You can use <span class="italic">mage hand</span> to attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks at range. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by an amount equal to 5 + 1 for every 5 feet the range is greater than 25 feet. You can't take 10 or 20 on this check. Any object manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. If you also possess the ranged legerdemain class feature, you no longer increase the skill check DC by 5 while using Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at range.

	<h4>Thunderstone Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Adventurer's Armory 2</span></p>
	In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (thunderstone) feat to use the following tricks.<br />
	<span class="bold">Deafening Component (ability to create bombs or cast any spell with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor)</span>: You can add a thunderstone as an additional material component to any spell you cast with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor, or to any bomb you throw. Any creature damaged by that spell or bomb must also succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour.<br />
	<span class="bold">Evolve Resilience (Knowledge [arcana] 1 rank, eidolon class feature)</span>: Your eidolon can consume a thunderstone as a standard action to bolster its resilience against certain effects. For 1 hour, your eidolon gains the resistance evolution (electricity or sonic only). Your eidolon cannot gain both resistances from this trick at the same time. During this time, the eidolon is immune to the effects of thunderstones.<br />
	<span class="bold">Startling Noise (Stealth 3 ranks or stalker vigilante specialization)</span>: Your thunderstones are especially effective when foes don't know they're coming. Any creature that is completely unaware of your presence takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against thunderstones you use and, if deafened, takes an amount of nonlethal damage equal to your number of sneak attack or hidden strike dice (if any).<br />
	<span class="bold">Thunderclap (Weapon Focus [any hammer])</span>: Your thunderstones enhance the concussive force of hammers you wield. This trick only works with hammers to which your Weapon Focus feat applies. As a move action, you can wedge a thunderstone in place on your hammer's striking surface. When you hit a foe with that hammer, the thunderstone detonates. You gain a +4 bonus on your saving throw against the thunderstone's effect (if necessary), and your foe takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw against the thunderstone's effect.

	<h4>Wondrous Item Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Dirty Tactics Toolbox</span></p>
	You can use these tricks with any wondrous item that can be worn in a specific magic item slot, such as the body or wrists.<br />
	<span class="bold">Aura Mastery (Use Magic Device 1 rank)</span>: Once per day, you can choose a single school of magic represented by one of your wondrous items' auras; you treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting a single spell of that school. You can make this choice at any time during the day, but you must choose the item (and school) before casting the spell.<br />
	<span class="bold">Counter Dispelling (Spellcraft 3 ranks)</span>: When a foe attempts a dispel check, such as via <span class="italic">dispel magic</span>, against either a wondrous item that you are currently wearing or wielding or a spell effect created by such an item, you can use your ranks in Use Magic Device as the item's caster level instead of its actual caster level when calculating the dispel check DC. You must be aware of the spell that is being cast and identify it with a successful Spellcraft check in order to receive this benefit.<br />
	<span class="bold">Favored Item (Magical Aptitude)</span>: Once per day, you can spend 1 hour practicing with a wondrous item to designate it as your favored item for that day. If the favored item functions for a specific number of rounds or minutes per day greater than 1 round or 1 minute, you increase the maximum number of rounds or minutes it can function that day by an amount equal to half your ranks in Use Magic Device (minimum 1 round).

	<h4>One-Handed Weapon Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	These weapon tricks are common among the Aldori swordlords and many weapon masters of Tian Xia. You can use these tricks only while wearing light or no armor, wielding a light or one-handed manufactured weapon in one hand, and holding nothing in your off hand.<br />
	<span class="bold">Free Hand Maneuver (base attack bonus +6)</span>: As a full-round action, you can make a single attack with your weapon and attempt to perform a dirty trick, disarm, drag, reposition, or steal combat maneuver with your free hand, taking no penalties for two-weapon fighting. The combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunities as normal, unless you have an appropriate ability or feat. You are not considered unarmed for this maneuver, but can't apply any benefits of your weapon to the combat maneuver check.<br />
	<span class="bold">Mindful Dodge (Dodge)</span>: As an immediate action, you can gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC against a single of which attack you are aware. You must make this decision before the attack roll is revealed. You are staggered on your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Strike and Seize (Improved Disarm, base attack bonus +6)</span>: As a standard action, you can make a single attack with your weapon and attempt to perform a disarm combat maneuver with your free hand, taking no penalties for two-weapon fighting.<br />
	<span class="bold">Stylish Riposte (Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +4)</span>: When your AC exceeds the result of a foe's melee attack against you by 5 or more, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Once you make such an attack of opportunity against a foe, you can't again use this trick against the foe that day.
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Martial Arts Handbook</span></p>
	You can use the following tricks only while wearing light or no armor, wielding a light or one-handed manufactured weapon in one hand, and holding nothing in your off hand.<br />
	<span class="bold">Grab and Stab (Improved Grapple, base attack bonus +6)</span>: As a standard action, you can initiate a grapple with your free hand (taking the usual -4 penalty for not having two hands free). If the attempt is successful, you can immediately follow up with an attack using your light or one-handed weapon as a free action. If you do so, you can't use any other abilities that are triggered by a successful grapple combat maneuver check (such as constrict). The grapple attempt provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless you have an ability or feat that prevents this.<br />
	<span class="bold">Switch Hands (Improved Feint)</span>: As a free action, you can pass a light or one-handed weapon you are wielding to your free hand. If you attempt a feint during the same round, you gain a +2 bonus on your Bluff check. Once you have used this weapon trick against a target, you can't gain the bonus against the same creature until 24 hours have passed.

	<h4>Polearm Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Weapon Master's Handbook</span></p>
	These weapon tricks are common in southern Garund and parts of Iobaria and Arcadia. You can use these tricks only while wielding a weapon from the polearm weapon group.<br />
	<span class="bold">Choke Up (Acrobatics 1 rank, Climb 1 rank)</span>: You can take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls until the beginning of your next turn in order to choke up on and wield a two-handed polearm sized for you in one hand, as long as you do not make attacks with your other hand.<br />
	<span class="bold">Close Sweep (Improved Bull Rush, Improved Reposition, or Improved Trip)</span>: You can attempt a bull rush, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check (one for which you have the matching prerequisite feat) against an adjacent foe, even if wielding a weapon with the reach quality.<br />
	<span class="bold">Haft Bash (Weapon Focus)</span>: You can accept a -2 penalty on attack rolls with a reach polearm for which you have Weapon Focus in order to treat the weapon as if it lacked the reach quality until the start of your next turn. If you do, the polearm functions as a club. Any qualities (such as trip) or special abilities (such as <span class="italic">keen</span>) of the weapon that a club could not have, and any feats or abilities you can't apply to a club, don't apply to attacks with the weapon during this time.<br />
	<span class="bold">Polearm Balance (Acrobatics 10 ranks)</span>: You can use a polearm to improve your balance. Any round in which you do not make a melee attack, you can take 10 on an Acrobatics check even when distraction would normally prevent you from doing so.<br />
	<span class="bold">Quick Brace (base attack bonus +6)</span>: While taking a full-attack action with a polearm with brace, you can ready an attack with the polearm in place of your final attack. The readied attack uses the attack bonus of the attack you used to ready it.
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Martial Arts Handbook</span></p>
	You can use the following trick only while wielding a weapon from the polearm weapon group.<br />

	These weapon tricks are common among the Chernasardo Rangers of Fangwood and the archers trained by House Narikopolus in Cheliax. You can use these tricks while wielding a ranged weapon.<br />
	<span class="bold">Hindering Shot (Precise Shot, Snap Shot)</span>: You can distract a foe at a crucial moment, making it vulnerable to your allies' abilities. You can ready an action to make a ranged attack against a foe when an ally forces the foe to attempt a saving throw. If your attack hits the foe and deals damage, the foe takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw that triggered your readied action.<br />
	<span class="bold">Suppressing Shot (Far Shot, Precise Shot)</span>: You can cover an ally's momentary vulnerability. You can ready an action to make a ranged attack against a foe when it makes an attack of opportunity. If your attack hits and damages the foe, the foe's attack of opportunity automatically misses its target.

	<span class="bold">Cleaving Smash (Cleave, Improved Vital Strike, Power Attack)</span>: When you use Cleave, you can add the additional damage from Vital Strike to both your initial and your secondary attacks. If you also have the Greater Vital Strike feat, you can instead add the damage from Improved Vital Strike to both your initial and your secondary attacks.<br />
	<span class="bold">Crush Armor (Improved Sunder, Power Attack)</span>: When you deal damage to a foe's armor with a successful sunder combat maneuver check while using a two-handed weapon, the foe must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or be fatigued for 1 round. If the armor has the broken condition after you damage it, the foe must continue making this save every round until he removes the armor or the armor loses the broken condition. If the armor is destroyed by your sunder attempt, the foe is automatically fatigued for 1 round. The foe cannot become exhausted this way.<br />
	<span class="bold">Two-Handed Menace (Intimidate 5 ranks)</span>: Capitalizing on the fear inspired by massive weapons, you can take 10 on Intimidate checks even when distracted or in combat.<br />
	<span class="bold">Warding Weapon (Combat Expertise)</span>: While you are using the total defense action, fighting defensively, or using Combat Expertise, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Martial Arts Handbook</span></p>
	You can use the following trick while wielding any two-handed weapon.<br />
	<span class="bold">One-Handed Lunge (base attack bonus +6)</span>: As a standard action, you can release one of your hands holding a two-handed weapon and make a melee attack with the weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for the duration of the attack. If the attack hits, you deal damage as if using a one-handed weapon, adding only your Strength bonus to damage if you are using your primary hand or half your Strength bonus if you are using your off hand, instead of 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. Otherwise, you take no penalty for using the weapon one-handed. The extra reach doesn't stack with the Lunge feat or other effects that extend your melee reach beyond that granted by your size category.

	<span class="bold">Arm Bind (Two-Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting)</span>: You can attempt a combat maneuver check to disarm a foe even if the foe has no weapons. This functions as the disarm combat maneuver. If you succeed and the foe has no weapon, you ensnare an arm of your choice, preventing your foe from using that limb until the end of your next turn. A foe can take a standard action to free its arm.<br />
	<span class="bold">Dual Strike (Double Slice, Improved Vital Strike)</span>: As a standard action, you can make two attacks, one with each weapon you're wielding, applying the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting to each.<br />

	<span class="bold">Feint and Bash (Improved Feint, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Bluff 10 ranks)</span>: When you feint successfully against a foe you threaten with your shield, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can only perform a shield bash with this attack of opportunity.<br />
	<span class="bold">Shielded View (Knowledge [dungeoneering] 1 rank)</span>: When you avert your eyes to avoid a gaze attack, you have an 80% chance to avoid having to attempt a saving throw against the gaze.<br />
	<span class="bold">Warded Movement (Dodge)</span>: As a swift action, you can choose a foe you can see. You can pass through that foe's threatened area without provoking attacks of opportunity from that foe this round. Once you target a foe with this trick, you can't target it again that day.

	<h4>Daylight Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Though many clerics in the church of Sarenrae can conjure powerful light, it was a warpriest named Amnok who learned to focus it through his shield and blind Sarenrae's foes. He later learned how to conjure a burst of pure daylight, shining like the sun for several seconds and defeating an entire cabal of vampires. Most of the manipulations of the <span class="italic">daylight</span> spell come from Amnok's early work. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">daylight</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Barrier of Light (Shield Focus)</span>: When you cast <span class="italic">daylight</span> on a shield, it sheds bright light in a 120-foot cone and raises the light level by one step for an additional 120 feet. As a standard action, you can end the spell by causing the light to suddenly flash, blinding each creature in the cone for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your <span class="italic">daylight</span> spell DC.<br />
	<span class="bold">Blades of Light (Knowledge [religion] 6 ranks)</span>: When you cast <span class="italic">daylight</span> on a melee weapon, you can reduce the duration to 1 round per level and grant the weapon the ability to deal additional damage against undead and evil outsiders equal to 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +5). This extra damage does not stack with the <span class="italic">holy</span> weapon enchantment and similar effects.<br />
	<span class="bold">Burst of Sunlight (Spellcraft 6 ranks or worship deity with Sun domain)</span>: You can reduce the duration of your <span class="italic">daylight</span> spell to 1 round, causing the spell to radiate the equivalent of pure daylight for the purpose of affecting creatures that are damaged, destroyed, or are otherwise affected by such light.<br />
	<span class="bold">Convincing Halo (Knowledge [religion] 3 ranks)</span>: When you cast <span class="italic">daylight</span> on a piece of headgear, you can make it appear as a halo. This grants the creature wearing the headgear a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks against good outsiders.<br />
	<span class="bold">Pin Sunlight (Precise Shot)</span>: When you cast <span class="italic">daylight</span> on a piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, you can cause the spell to transfer to the target of a successful ranged attack with that piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, causing the creature to radiate light from its body. If the creature succeeds at a Will save against your <span class="italic">daylight</span> spell DC, it instead glows with dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 minute.<br />
	<span class="bold">Vessel of Light (no additional prerequisites)</span>: When you cast <span class="italic">daylight</span> on a torch, lantern, or other tool used to produce mundane light, you increase the duration of your spell to 1 hour per level.

	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Vincent the Pyroclastic is a destructive force in the Society. He has caused permanent damage to and condemnation of more buildings in the Inner Sea region than any other agent. For him, incineration became an art. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">fireball</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Alchemist's Inferno (Craft [alchemy] 9 ranks, Spellcraft 9 ranks)</span>: Using alchemist's fire as a material component, your <span class="italic">fireball</span> sets everything it touches ablaze. The initial blast deals half as much damage, but targets that fail their Reflex saves also catch fire. A creature that catches fire in this way must attempt a Reflex save against the DC of the <span class="italic">fireball</span> spell to stop burning instead of the typical DC. Unattended objects automatically catch fire, though nonflammable objects burn for only 1 additional round.<br />
	<span class="bold">Cluster Bomb (Spellcraft 6 ranks)</span>: You are able to throw multiple small explosions with a single spell instead of the normal effect. For every 2 caster levels, you toss a miniature <span class="italic">fireball</span> with a 10-foot radius that deals 2d6 points of fire damage. The grid intersection of all blasts must be within 30 feet of each other. If a creature is in the area of multiple blasts, it attempts a single Reflex save against the combined damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Concentrated Fire (Selective Spell or Widen Spell, Spellcraft 6 ranks)</span>: You can reduce the radius of your <span class="italic">fireball</span> by increments of 5 feet, to a minimum of a 5-foot radius. For each 5-foot increment you reduce the spell, you increase the spell's damage by 1d6. This additional damage can exceed the spell's maximum damage.<br />
	<span class="bold">Sculpt Flames (Reach Spell, Selective Spell)</span>: You can alter the shape of your <span class="italic">fireball</span> to send its fire along the path you desire. When casting the spell, you can change the area to one 5-foot square per caster level. The spell's area must be continuous and unbroken when cast. If its blocked or otherwise interrupted by a 5-foot wide or larger environmental feature like a wall, the spell fails. A creature only takes damage once from a <span class="italic">fireball</span> cast in this way, even if the spell's area intersects with the creature multiple times.<br />
	<span class="bold">Where There's Smoke (Craft [alchemy] 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks)</span>: Using a smokestick as a material component, you make your <span class="italic">fireball</span> leave behind a thick cloud of smoke in the spell's area for 1 minute. A moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round as a smokestick. When using a smokestick in this way, your <span class="italic">fireball</span> deals only 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6).

	<h4>Floating Disk Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Distant Realms</span></p>
	Although most spellcasters use <span class="italic">floating disks</span> as little more than a means of moving luggage, the shulsagas of the Astral Plane have mastered the ability to ride atop a <span class="bold">floating disk</span>. A combination of cultural importance, astral secrets, and constant practice allows shulsagas to push the spell's magic beyond its normal limits. Masters of the art can perform truly extraordinary maneuvers with proper training. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="bold">floating disk</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Defensive Disk (Fly 3 ranks, Shield Proficiency)</span>: While riding atop your <span class="italic">floating disk</span> with at least one hand free, you can spend a move action to grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your <span class="italic">floating disk</span> grants you the benefits of the spell <span class="italic">shield</span>. If you are already under the effects of the <span class="italic">shield</span> spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell's shield bonus by 1 until the beginning of your next turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Disk Rider (Fly 3 ranks)</span>: You can ride atop any <span class="italic">floating disk</span> you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within the Astral Plane, including Yulgamot itself, the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast <span class="italic">floating disk</span>, you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell.<br />
	<span class="bold">Drifting Defense (Fly 6 ranks, Mobility, Shield Proficiency)</span>: Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you can activate the defensive disk trick as a free action.<br />
	<span class="bold">Expanded Disk (Fly 3 ranks, Heighten Spell)</span>: If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger <span class="italic">floating disk</span> capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature). Once created, a disk augmented with this trick will always support the weight of you and your personal gear, even if this combined mass exceeds the disk's capacity.<br />
	<span class="bold">Force Check (Fly 3 ranks, Catch Off-Guard or Improved Bull Rush)</span>: When you successfully charge and bull rush a creature while riding atop your <span class="italic">floating disk</span>, you can veer the disk into your target, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to moving the target. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against any attack of opportunity attempted against you when performing a bull rush in this way.<br />
	<span class="bold">Spurn Gravity (Fly 6 ranks)</span>: While astride your <span class="italic">floating disk</span>, you can fly higher than 5 feet above the ground. However, you must return to a location 5 feet above a stable surface before the end of your turn or fall. If you take damage from this fall, you fall prone atop your <span class="italic">floating disk</span>. As a swift action, you can also reduce the remaining duration of your floating disk to 1 round per level. For the remaining duration of the spell, your fly speed increases to 50 feet and your disk ignores all altitude limitations.

	<h4>Mage Hand Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Cylindia the Sly was a renowned cat burglar throughout Magnimar. Though she never had any formal magical training, her ancestor's magical blood was all she needed to produce and master the use of <span class="italic">mage hand</span>. She remains unique in that her adaptations to the spell came entirely from practical applications rather than study and experimentation. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">mage hand</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Dirty Magic Trick (base attack bonus +1, Improved Dirty Trick)</span>: You can manipulate a target's clothing or a nearby object to attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against a single opponent in the spell's range, using your combat maneuver bonus for the check.<br />
	<span class="bold">Powerful Hand (Spellcraft 3 ranks)</span>: You can increase the weight of objects you can move by 5 pounds for every 3 ranks you have in Spellcraft.<br />
	<span class="bold">Ranged Aid (base attack bonus +1)</span>: You've learned to use your <span class="italic">mage hand</span> to tug at an opponent's hair, clothing, and equipment. You can use the aid another action at range, attempting a ranged touch attack instead of a melee attack.<br />
	<span class="bold">Reaching Hand (Precise Shot or Reach Spell)</span>: You can focus as a swift action before casting <span class="italic">mage hand</span> to increase its range to 50 feet + 5 feet per caster level. If the target of your <span class="italic">mage hand</span> spell is outside of the spell's standard range at the start of your turn, you must spend another swift action to focus again or the spell immediately ends.<br />
	<span class="bold">Subtle Hand (Deft Hands, Disable Device 6 ranks, Sleight of Hand 6 ranks)</span>: You can attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks within range of your <span class="italic">mage hand</span>. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and you cannot take 10 on this check.<br />
	<span class="bold">Throw Punch (Improved Unarmed Strike)</span>: You can use <span class="italic">mage hand</span> to strike an opponent within the spell's range. This is a melee attack that always deals 1d3 points of force damage. The <span class="italic">mage hand</span> has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Spell resistance applies against this ability.

	<h4>Obscuring Mist Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Shastalla of the Shackles was a bloodthirsty pirate, famous for her raids on Chelish patrols under the cover of <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span>. After Shastalla was caught and executed, the Pathfinder Society purchased her magical library for a small fortune to learn her secrets. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">obscuring mist</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Clinging Mist (Extend Spell, Spellcraft 6 ranks)</span>: Your thick mist is difficult to escape. A creature that leaves the <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span> continues to treat other creatures as if they had concealment for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.<br />
	<span class="bold">Hydrating Mist (Survival 3 ranks)</span>: Your mist clings to creatures, soaking them and their equipment. This grants each creature a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist effects of heat and a -4 penalty on saves against effects that deal electricity damage and spells with the electricity descriptor. This effect functions as submersion in water for aquatic creatures and penetrates the skin, hydrating creatures in the mist as if they consumed a canteen full of water.<br />
	<span class="bold">Mist Screen (Heighten Spell)</span>: You can shape your <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span> into a dense wall of mist with an area up to one 10-foot square per 2 levels. The sections of wall are 5 feet thick and must remain contiguous, but they do not need to be anchored to a solid surface. At least one section of the wall must include your space. Creatures standing within the wall have concealment. Creatures on the opposite side of the wall have total concealment.<br />
	<span class="bold">Obscure Self (Stealth 6 ranks)</span>: You reduce the area of the <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span> to your space plus all adjacent squares, but the mist is no longer stationary and instead automatically moves with you when you move. This does not create enough concealment to attempt Stealth checks. As a swift action, you can anchor the mist, causing it to become stationary and allowing enough concealment to hide. You can release the mist as a swift action, allowing it to move with you again. If you take any fire damage while this trick is in effect, the spell immediately ends.<br />
	<span class="bold">Obscure Terrain (Selective Spell)</span>: Your mist rests low to the ground, blocking sight to all underfoot and making the area difficult to traverse. Your <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span> takes up the same area, but no longer blocks sight of other creatures. Instead, all creatures moving through the mist treat the area as difficult terrain. A creature can spend a move action to treat the area as normal terrain until the end of its turn.<br />
	<span class="bold">Quenching Mist (Spellcraft 6 ranks or water subtype)</span>: You can issue a forceful blast of pressurized mist in a 15-foot cone instead of casting <span class="italic">obscuring mist</span> normally. This blast automatically quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as <span class="italic">dispel magic</span> against magical fires as long as those fires are Medium or smaller. The duration changes to instantaneous and the spell gains the water descriptor. Creatures with the fire subtype within the cone take 1d6 points of damage for every 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) you have (half on a successful Reflex save).

	<h4>Prestidigitation Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Though magical practitioners around the multiverse make daily use of <span class="italic">prestidigitation</span>, Poshment the Peculiar was the first to dabble in <span class="italic">prestidigitation</span>'s many possibilities. Through dedicated study and dubious field tests, he was able to find many more uses than dying his clothes and cleaning up a spell component closet. By the time he had graduated from the Arcanamirium in Absalom, he had already learned to permanently dye clothes and even paint on canvas using only his spellwork. Over the years, he expanded <span class="italic">prestidigitation</span> from a multi-use spell to a work of art. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">prestidigitation</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Adjust Scent (Survival 6 ranks)</span>: You can adjust the smell of an object or willing creature to become more or less powerful, respectively doubling or reducing by half the distance needed to detect the target with the scent universal monster ability.<br />
	<span class="bold">Chromatic Savant (Disguise 3 ranks or gnome)</span>: When you change the color of an item, the changes are permanent. You can also change the color of part or all of a living being, but the effect gradually fades away in about a month. You must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to create complex or specific designs.<br />
	<span class="bold">Lasting Changes (Extend Spell)</span>: The effects of your <span class="italic">prestidigitation</span> spells persist for 1 hour per caster level; this does not change its spell level.<br />
	<span class="bold">Minor Levitation (Spellcraft 3 ranks)</span>: You can cause up to 1 pound of material to become weightless and direct it to move up to 5 feet each round as if under the effects of <span class="italic">levitate</span>.<br />
	<span class="bold">Repulsive Flavor (Craft [cooking] 3 ranks)</span>: You can cause a willing creature to taste foul. Once a creature with a bite attack successfully attacks the target of your spell, the target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and CMD against bite attacks and grapple checks made with a mouth, such as the grab ability or swallow whole, from that creature.<br />
	<span class="bold">Thaumaturgic Aesthetics (Bluff 3 ranks, Disguise 3 ranks, Deceptive)</span>: While you have a <span class="italic">prestidigitation</span> spell active, you can thematically change the effects of other spells you cast, such as changing the color of a <span class="italic">fireball</span>, granting your <span class="italic">magic missile</span> a specific shape, or adding a floral smell to your <span class="italic">mage armor</span>. This increases the DC of Spellcraft and Knowledge (arcana) checks to identify your magic by an amount equal to half of your ranks in Disguise (minimum 1).

	<h4>Shield Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Kah'la is one of the more studious magi to ever graduate from the Arcanamirium. Though her professors had hoped she would make a fine magical theoretician, she joined the Pathfinder Society and put her theories on abjuration to good use. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parenthesis for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">shield</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Friendly Shield (Bodyguard)</span>: When using the Bodyguard feat, you can instead grant your ally the benefit of your active <span class="italic">shield</span> spell. You lose the spell's benefits and your ally gains these benefits for the spell's duration.<br />
	<span class="bold">Force Bash (Improved Bull Rush, Improved Shield Bash)</span>: While the <span class="italic">shield</span> spell is active, as a standard action you can cause your <span class="italic">shield</span> to fly toward a target within 30 feet and attempt to bash it. On a successful ranged attack roll, the spell deals 1d8 points of force damage plus 1 point per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). If it deals damage, you can also attempt a bull rush combat maneuver with the shield as a free action. The <span class="italic">shield</span> has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Using the <span class="italic">shield</span> in this way consumes 1 minute of the spell's duration. Spell resistance applies against this ability.<br />
	<span class="bold">Force Equipment (Equipment Trick [shield])</span>: You can use your <span class="italic">shield</span> spell with the Equipment Trick (shield) feat for the following tricks: Break Ground, Hurl Shield, Little Wall, Ricochet Shield, Shield Gag.<br />
	<span class="bold">Instant Cover (Spellcraft 6 ranks)</span>: While the <span class="italic">shield</span> spell is active, as an immediate action you can expand your <span class="italic">shield</span> into a tower shield made of force. Choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a <span class="italic">wall of force</span>, except for each 2 caster levels it has hardness 5 and 5 hit points. At the end of the current creature's turn, the <span class="italic">shield</span> spell immediately ends.<br />
	<span class="bold">Reflective Shield (Spellcraft 9 ranks)</span>: While the <span class="italic">shield</span> spell is active, as an immediate action you can reflect <span class="italic">magic missile</span> spells back on their caster as if using spell turning. Using the <span class="italic">shield</span> in this way consumes 1 minute of the spell's duration.

	<h4>Unseen Servant Tricks</h4>
	<p class="source"><span class="bold">Source</span>: <span class="under">Chronicle of Legends</span></p>
	Who better than Seganam, a conjuration professor at Korvosa's Acadamae, to discover a variety of applications for <span class="italic">unseen servant</span>. Originally he modified the spell to assist with his alchemical experiments, but over time he learned to make these servants function in a variety of ways. Today, armor-clad servants stand perpetual guard outside his office. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (<span class="italic">unseen servant</span>) feat to use the trick.<br />
	<span class="bold">Phantom Decoy (Disguise 6 ranks)</span>: Your servant can inhabit a suit of armor as if wearing it, appearing as haunted armor. This reduces the <span class="italic">unseen servant</span>'s movement speed as normal armor would. Attacks against the <span class="italic">unseen servant</span> target an AC equal to 10 plus the armor bonus from the armor. Any successful attack damages the armor as if it were targeted by a sunder combat maneuver. An area effect that deals 6 or more points of damage destroys the <span class="italic">unseen servant</span> as usual.<br />
	<span class="bold">Unfettered Servant (Reach Spell)</span>: Without increasing the spell slot, you increase the range of your <span class="italic">unseen servant</span> to long. If the servant moves beyond the spell's range, it finishes its current task before it ceases to exist.<br />
	<span class="bold">Unseen Apprentice (Combat Casting, Spellcraft 3 ranks)</span>: You servant is gifted with a spark of magical prowess. If the servant is adjacent to you when you attempt a concentration check, you gain a +1 bonus to the check. This bonus increases to +2 when you have 10 or more ranks in Spellcraft.<br />
	<span class="bold">Unseen Assistant (Craft [any], Perform [any], or Profession [any] 3 ranks)</span>: You infuse your servant with the spirit of creativity. It can assist you as if successfully using the aid another action with a single Craft, Profession, or Perform skill in which you have 3 or more ranks. Alternatively, it can use any of these skills itself, using half of your total bonus for that skill.<br />
	<span class="bold">Unseen Squire (armor proficiency)</span>: Your servant can assist any character in donning armor with which you are proficient. When doing so, that character is considered as having help to don her armor and can do so in half the usual time: 5 rounds for light armor, 1 minute for medium armor, or 2 minutes for heavy armor.<br />
	<span class="bold">Unseen Warrior (base attack bonus +3)</span>: You imbue your servant with the spirit of battle, reducing the duration to 1 round per level but allowing it to take aid another actions in battle on your turn. The servant has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.
