The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a -1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.<br />A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.<br />If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level, its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.<br />´´´Number of Followers by Level´´´: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat.<br />Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult the table above to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.|||||||||||1|1|129

If you hit (whether or not the attack damages the target), the hammer rebounds off of the creature and lands in your square. If you have the Snatch Arrows feat, you may choose to catch the hammer when it enters your square (though this does not give you the ability to immediately throw the hammer). This ability may not work against some creatures or in certain circumstances as determined by the GM; for example, your weapon does not bounce off incorporeal creatures (unless it has the ´´´ghost touch´´´ ability), it may stick to creatures with the adhesive ability, the slowing effect of fighting underwater prevents you from using this feat, and so on.|A thrown weapon drops in the square where it hit its target.||||||||||21|8|20

If you fail to trip your opponent, your opponent does not get an attempt to trip you in return.<br />This ability may not work in certain circumstances as determined by the GM, such as if the ground is soft, there is an obstacle or difficult terrain on the floor between you and your target, and so on.|||||||||||21|8|21

213|possess creature|28|6:20||99|||||||Gain the ability to possess living creatures|A fiend gains the ability to merge its physical form with another creature's body, spreading its foul influence from within a living vessel.|Cha 20; any evil outsider with 10 or more Hit Dice|Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend can discorporate into a malign presence and target a creature within 15 feet. The creature targeted must succeed at a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier or be possessed (see below). Targets under the effects of ´´´protection from evil´´´, or related spells, gain a bonus to this save. Should a target succeed at its Will save, the fiend is forced back into its natural form and is stunned for 1 round.<br />A fiend that successfully possesses a target enters its space and merges with it. While possessing a creature or object, a fiend's body and abilities are unavailable. Once a fiend merges with its target it cannot be harmed until it leaves or is forcibly removed. While possessing a target, a fiend shares the senses of its host and can communicate with it telepathically. A fiend also gains a number of possession points per day equal to its total Hit Dice. These points can be spent to utilize special bodily possession actions detailed below. A fiend may expend these points as it pleases, with each possession action taking a full-round action.<br />Each day, the victim of a possession is allowed a new Will save at the original DC to force the possessing fiend to leave its body-objects and areas do not receive daily saves. Should a victim make this save or be killed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is stunned for 1 round. A fiend may not possess a new target for 24 hours after being ejected from a victim. ´´´Dispel evil´´´ (or ´´´dispel chaos´´´ or ´´´dispel law´´´, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. ´´´Banishment´´´ and ´´´dismissal´´´ immediately eject a fiend from a target if it fails to save against the spell.|||||||||||22|9|57
214|possess location|28|6:16||99|||||||Gain the ability to possess structures and small areas|A fiend learns to disperse its essence over an area, gaining mastery over features and structures there and tainting the place with its wickedness.|Cha 16; any evil outsider with 8 or more Hit Dice|Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend may attempt to possess a structure or small area (like a pool, grove, or ruin) of a diameter equal to 10 feet per Hit Die. This area is spherical, so a fiend possessing a particularly large structure might only have power over a certain number of rooms. An area receives no save against fiendish possession unless creatures or magical items occupy the space, in which case the area makes a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier using the stats of the occupant with the highest Will save. An area within the effects of a ´´´hallow´´´ spell cannot be possessed. A fiend possessing an area operates similarly to one using the Possess Creature feat, except that locations do not receive daily saves to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's possession points can only be spent on location possession actions.<br />Should a possessed location be destroyed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in a space adjacent to the area it previously possessed, and is stunned for 1 round. ´´´Dispel evil´´´ (or ´´´dispel chaos´´´ or ´´´dispel law´´´, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. ´´´Banishment´´´ and ´´´dismissal´´´ immediately eject a fiend from an object if it fails to make its saving throw against the spell's effects.|||||||||||22|9|57
215|possess object|28|6:18||99|||||||Gain the ability to possess inanimate objects|A fiend gains the power to bind its malign essence to a single object, corrupting it into a relic of undeniable evil.|Cha 18; any evil outsider with 9 or more Hit Dice|Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend can possess a Large or smaller object. Unattended, a mundane object receives no saving throw against possession, while an attended object uses its owner's saving throw to make a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier. Magic items save as if they were subject to a spell. Items within the area of effect of a ´´´hallow´´´ spell cannot be possessed. This effect is similar to that detailed in the Possess Creature feat, except that objects do not receive a daily save to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's possession points can only be spent on object-possession actions.<br />Should a possessed object be destroyed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is stunned for 1 round. ´´´Dispel evil´´´ (or ´´´dispel chaos´´´ or ´´´dispel law´´´, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. ´´´Banishment´´´ and ´´´dismissal´´´ immediately eject a fiend from an object if it fails to make its saving throw against the spell's effects.|||||||||||22|9|58

The spell's duration becomes &quot;1 hour or until discharged.&quot; For the next hour, the spell remains on the target, triggering automatically as a swift action if the creature takes damage or experiences an effect that the spell could cure, mitigate, or remove (which causes the wings of light to appear briefly).<br />For example, if you cast ´´´lesser restoration´´´ on an ally who had no ability damage, the spell would trigger immediately if the target became fatigued, exhausted, or took ability damage, but not if the target suffered ability drain, energy drain, or hit point damage (none of which are affected by ´´´lesser restoration´´´).|||||||||||21|11|13

#AP 30 (02.2010)
223|invested magic|16||||||||||Use gold or gems instead of normal spell material components|Spells cast using this feat pay the wages of Mammon and forgo their more mundane costs.||You may satisfy the material requirement of any spell you cast with valuable coins, gems, or jewelry rather than the normal component. For spells with material components with no listed value, valuables worth 5 times the spell's level in gp may be expended instead of the usual components (5 gp for a 1st-level spell, 20 gp for a 4th-level spell, etc). In the case of spells with components that have a listed cost, you may expend valuables worth a number of gp equal to one and a half times this cost (thus, a spell like ´´´commune´´´ with material components costing 500 gp could be cast using valuables worth 750 gp). Only coins, gems, jewelry, and other similar objects of obvious worth can be used to replace other material components using this feat. The value of these objects need not match the required cost exactly, but they cannot be less than the required costs. Should valuables of greater value than required be expended (likely when employing objects like gems or jewelry), the extraneous gp value is lost, consumed with the rest of the object. The only exception comes in the case of spells with material components that have a listed worth. When casting such spells you may expend double the components' gp worth in valuables to cast the spell as if your caster level were 1 level higher. This effect only applies to spells with components with a specific gp value. Any expenditure beyond double the gp value grants no additional benefit.|||||||||||22|13|69

#Classic Treasures Revisited (04.2010)
224|companion figurine|16|||||||||11:1|Make a ´´´figurine of wondrous power´´´ your animal companion or familiar|You've developed an especially close bond with the creature summoned by your figurine of wondrous power.|Handle Animal 1 rank; own a ´´´figurine of wondrous power´´´|You may select the creature summoned by your ´´´figurine of wondrous power´´´ as an animal companion or familiar, or as appropriate. The figurine has the standard abilities of a familiar or animal companion of its type, plus additional abilities related to its figurine type (see below). The main advantage of this is that if your familiar or companion is killed in creature form, it merely reverts to statue form and can be used again later. The following standard figurines are available as animal companions (C) or familiars (F).<br />´´´Ebony Fly´´´ (C): You must have the Vermin Heart feat to select this creature as an animal companion. It is treated as a horse animal companion, and at 8th level it gains a fly speed of 120 feet (average maneuverability).<br />´´´Golden Lions´´´ (C): When you select a ´´´golden lion´´´ as an animal companion, one of the pair becomes your companion and the other retains its standard figurine abilities.<br />´´´Ivory Goats´´´ (C): When selecting an ´´´ivory goat´´´ as an animal companion, you select one of the three goats in the set (´´´traveling´´´, ´´´travail´´´, or ´´´terror´´´) as your companion; the others remain standard figurines. All three goats are treated as horse companions. The goat of traveling never suffers from fatigue or exhaustion from extended travel. The goat of travail has 2 horn attacks (1d8 + Str bonus) in addition to a horse's normal attacks. The goat of terror has the fear aura and magical weapon horns as described in its figurine entry.<br />´´´Marble Elephant´´´ (C): The elephant is treated as an elephant companion.<br />´´´Serpentine Owl´´´ (C, F): The owl is treated as a bird animal companion or an owl familiar, but only in its Small horned owl form. In its giant owl form, it is merely a creature, not an animal companion or familiar. After three uses of its giant owl form, the figurine loses that transformation ability forever but still functions normally in its horned owl form as an animal companion or familiar.<br />´´´Silver Raven´´´ (C, F): The raven is treated as a bird animal companion or a raven familiar. It retains its metallic appearance and ´´´animal messenger´´´ ability (though this is redundant for an intelligent familiar) but not its hardness when in animal form.<br />While the figurine is active, you and the active figurine gain all the normal benefits of having a companion creature; for example, a wizard with a ´´´silver raven´´´ familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks, the raven can speak one language, and so on. While the figurine is inactive, you gain none of these benefits but are not otherwise hampered by its inert state (as if the creature were out of range but not dead). The usable duration of the companion figurine doubles; for example, an ´´´ebony fly´´´ is normally usable up to three times per week for up to 12 hours per use, but as a companion creature you may use it up to six times per week for up to 12 hours per use. The figurine is still a magic item and is subject to effects like ´´´antimagic field´´´ and ´´´dispel magic´´´ that affect magic items; it uses its caster level or your own, whichever is greater.|||||||||||20|14|25

247|arcane school spirit|16|||3||||||3:1|Talk up your spells, making them harder to resist|You can talk up the power of your own school of magic to such an extent that creatures find it more difficult to resist your spells.|Gnome; Bluff 1 rank; arcane school class feature|As a full-round action, you extol the virtues of your school of magic to one creature within 30 feet. Make a Bluff check opposed by a target's Sense Motive check; if you win the check, the target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws made to resist the next spell of this school that you cast. If your chosen school is universalist, choose a specific school each time you use this ability. If your Bluff check succeeds, however, your lack of true commitment to the school means the target takes only a -1 penalty on its saving throw.|||||||||||21|17|30
248|babble-peddler|16|||3||||||2:5;3:5|Trick creatures into exchanging valuable things for junk|Your talent for flimflam allows you to trick creatures into exchanging valuable objects for whatever junk you happen to offer.|Gnome; Appraise 5 ranks; Bluff 5 ranks|Make a Bluff check to praise the value and worth of an object in your hand while denigrating an object held by a nearby creature; this takes anywhere from 1 round to 1 minute depending on the appearance and nature of the items. If the creature fails its check, it agrees to exchange your object for its own. Obvious differences in the value between the exchanged items give your roll a +4 or -4 modifier, at the GM's discretion (offering a clay cup for a jeweled dagger gives your roll a -4 penalty). The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn't trade his crown for any item, and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens by one category.<br />Once the exchange happens, make an Appraise roll opposed by the target's Appraise or Sense Motive roll. If the target wins, it immediately realizes the true value of the object you offered it and behaves accordingly. If you succeed, it believes your false assessment for 1 round; for every 5 by which your check exceeds your opponent's check, the deception lasts 1 more round. As with disbelieving illusions, the target's ally can point out the true value of the object, giving the target another check with a +2 bonus.<br />You cannot use this ability in combat, against a creature whose attitude toward you is hostile or unfriendly, against a creature that does not understand you, or against a creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or less.|||||||||||21|17|30

If the creature fails its check, you choose whether it loses its next action or you gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make against that creature for 1 round.|||||||||||21|17|30

For example, a gnome sorcerer with the draconic bloodline may use this feat against dragons and their kin, but no other creatures.|||||||||||21|17|30
251|caustic slur|16|||3||||||3:1|Insult your favored enemies to anger them|You know exactly how to insult your favored enemies in order to make them lose their heads.|Gnome; Bluff 1 rank; favored enemy class feature|As a standard action, you can make a Bluff check against one sort of favored enemy. Any creature of that type within 60 feet of you must make a Will saving throw or become angered. If an affected creature attacks you, it's treated as if it were using Power Attack (taking a penalty on attack rolls but gaining a bonus on damage rolls). If the creature already has the power attack feat, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the damage bonus increases by 2. These modifiers end when combat ends. This ability does not work on creatures that cannot understand you, though sometimes a simple gesture is sufficient for an intelligent opponent to catch your gist regardless of any language barrier.|||||||||||21|17|30

This has no effect on spells of other schools or on illusion spells with durations that don't depend on your active concentration.

You can use these in any combination; for example, you can use ´´´dancing lights´´´ four times in one day (taking all three additional uses for the same spell), or you can cast ´´´ghost sound´´´ twice, ´´´prestidigitation´´´ twice, ´´´speak with animals´´´ twice, and ´´´dancing lights´´´ once. If you have a feat, trait, or other ability that changes your racial 0-level spell-like abilities to other 0-level spells, this feat applies to them instead.|||||||||||21|17|26

If the creature knows you are dangerous, it adds a +4 bonus to its Sense Motive check. If you win the check, the target does something intended to make you a little more comfortable, or at least shut you up, that gives you a +5 bonus on your next Escape Artist check.||||||At the GM's discretion, an especially evil or cruel creature may gain a +2 bonus to its Sense Motive check to resist this ability. If it succeeds, it does something to make your bindings even more secure and less comfortable, giving you a -5 penalty on all Escape Artist checks made in those particular bonds.|||||21|17|30

All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against your Bluff check DC regard you as a figure of either fear or contempt (your choice applies to all affected creatures). If you choose fear, the targets are frightened for 1 round per druid level. If you choose contempt, the targets consider you harmless for 1 minute, ignoring you unless you attack them or take a threatening action.|||||||||||21|17|30

The effect of the feint lasts only until the first time you hit the target.|||||||||||21|17|30
258|threatening illusion|22||144|3|||||||Force enemies to think of your illusions as real threats|You've mastered the art of making illusions that force foes to divide their attention in combat.|Spell Focus (illusion); gnome|You can use this metamagic feat only on illusion (figment) spells.<br />A threatening illusion spell causes one target to believe your illusion is a threat. Choose one 5-foot square within the area of your illusion; that square threatens the target as long as it is adjacent. Thus, if you or an ally is on the opposite side of the target, it is considered flanking.<br />Normally the area must contain an illusory creature of Small or Medium size. However, you can select one square of a larger illusory creature to threaten the target. For example, an illusory Large ogre takes up four 5-foot squares; you select one square to be the source of the threat, and its other three squares do not threaten anyone.<br />If the target has reason to believe there is an invisible creature in the vicinity, even an auditory illusion with no visual elements (such as ´´´ghost sound´´´) is sufficient to convince the target that the selected square contains an actual threat. As long as you maintain the illusion, you can change the location of the threatening square as a swift action.<br />When you threaten a target with this spell, the foe may make a Will save to disbelieve (DC 10 + threatening spell's level + your spellcasting ability score modifier). If the target makes this save, the threatening effect of this feat no longer applies to it.<br />A threatening illusion takes up a spell slot one level higher than normal.|Illusion spells do not threaten squares.||||||||||21|17|27

When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots.<br />When a creature drinks a sanguine elixir, it can activate the bloodline power anytime before the end of its next turn, as if it had access to that bloodline power. A creature that drinks the elixir cannot gain the benefit if its character level does not equal or exceed the minimum level of the bloodline power. Any level-dependent effects use the character level of the creature that drinks the sanguine elixir, or your sorcerer level, whichever is lower. Drinking a sanguine elixir is just like drinking a potion. A sanguine elixir is treated as a magic item with your caster level.

This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.<br />If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).<br />Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a ´´´dispel magic´´´ spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC = 11 + alchemist's caster level).|||||||||||4|27|152

A vampire may also free a vampiric companion in order to enslave a new one, but once freed, the vampiric animal cannot be enslaved again.<br />A vampiric animal's statistics are identical to those of the original animal, save for the following changes.[[[7]]]|||||||||||20|28|47

If using an item that is recognizable as a magical implement (such as a wand or ring), you can trick viewers into thinking you are just using the item as a focus component. Onlookers who have no ranks in Spellcraft have no knowledge of what is genuine spellcasting, and automatically believe you are casting a spell.<br />If an onlooker attempts a Spellcraft check to identify your &quot;casting&quot;, his check is opposed by your Bluff check. If he succeeds, he realizes the deception. If he fails, he believes you cast the spell. Regardless of the result of that opposed check, he uses the result of that Spellcraft check to identify the &quot;spell&quot; you cast, except the DC is 20 + the spell's level instead of 15 + the spell's level.|||||||||||20|32|10

For example, if you use a silver holy symbol worth 25 gp, you do not have to provide material components for an arcane spell if its components are worth 25 gp or less. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots.<br />Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of ´´´dispel magic´´´. The spell ´´´erase´´´ can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to erase the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the tattoo must be dealt to destroy a magical tattoo in this manner.<br />Magical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the Craft (calligraphy, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes.|||||||||||20|32|16

The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as ´´´minor image´´´, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figment's duration.<br />You must either make a melee touch attack or give the target a saving throw (Fortitude or Reflex) to resist the damage (see below). If you choose a melee touch attack, you use your own melee touch attack bonus, and if you miss, the spell deals no damage. If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level. If the target disbelieves or sees through the illusion, reduce the damage by half.<br />The shadowy attack can deal acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing damage, but the damage must be appropriate to the illusion. For example, an illusory wall that collapses deals bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude save for half, an illusory swordsman strikes with a melee touch attack deals slashing damage, and an illusory wall of fire deals fire damage with a Reflex save for half.|||||||||||20|32|15
864|shadow grasp|22||866||||||||Entangle creatures caught within your darkness spells|Your darkness spells have substance and bind your foes.|Umbral Spell|When you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are entangled. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell's DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome a creature's spell resistance means it is not entangled.<br />An entangled creature remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw to avoid becoming entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being entangled do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened area.<br />You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat.

Any attempts at dispelling a tenebrous spell in darkness or dim light take a -2 penalty on the dispel check.<br />Casting a tenebrous spell in bright light is difficult, and requires a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the tenebrous spell's effective spell level). Attempts to dispel a tenebrous spell in bright light gain a +4 bonus on the dispel check.<br />You cannot use this feat on spells with the light descriptor. A tenebrous spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level, except in the case of spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor or of the illusion (shadow) subschool; this feat does not change the effective level of those spells (but still counts as using a metamagic feat for all other purposes).|||||||||||20|32|15
866|umbral spell|22||865||||||||Alter a spell to radiate darkness|Targets of your darkness spells radiate darkness.|Tenebrous Spell|An umbral spell gains the darkness descriptor. As long as the spell is in effect, the creature or object affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination similar to the effects of the darkness spell. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected by an umbral spell if they are of a higher level than the umbral spell's unmodified spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that creates darkness. An umbral spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.<br />You cannot use this feat on a spell with an instantaneous duration or a spell that does not target a creature or object.|||||||||||20|32|15

This bonus natural attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity itself and deals base damage appropriate for a creature of your current size (usually 1d4 for Small creatures).

This round of rage does not count toward the total number of rounds which you can rage each day, but if you wish to continue your rage beyond that single round you must expend rounds from your daily rage allotment as normal.

To do so, you must make an Acrobatics check (DC = 5 + the damage dealt from the attack) as an immediate action. If you succeed in this check, you take no damage from the actual attack but instead convert that damage into movement with each point equating to 1 foot of movement. For example, if you would have taken 6 points of damage, you would convert that into 6 feet of movement. You immediately move in a straight line in a direction of your choice this number of feet (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot-square), halting if you reach a distance equal to your actual speed.

Each round of rage you spend reduces the attack's damage by 1 point, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit point.<br />For example, if you are raging, have a raging Constitution score of 18, are currently at 2 hit points, and take 20 hit points of damage from a hit (which is enough to bring you to -18 hit points, thereby killing you), you may spend 1 round of rage to reduce the damage by 1 hit point (leaving you perilously close to death at -17 hit points); if you spend 17 rounds of rage, you reduce the damage to 1 (the minimum), leaving you with 1 hit point.<br />If this damage still makes you fall unconscious, your rage ends just like it normally would, lowering your Constitution to its normal value and reducing your hit point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this feat to prevent yourself from instantly dying, yet you still die because your negative hit points exceed your normal Constitution score. Take your normal Constitution into account when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend with this feat.||||||||When using this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points in place of 1 round of rage to gain the same effects.|96|119|6|38|57

1100|squire|16||||4||||||Attract a squire to aid in your knightly endeavors|You attract a squire to aid you in your knightly endeavors.|Character level 4th; proficient with all martial weapons|This feat acts similarly to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can only attract a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a squire) with this feat, and cannot recruit followers until you have the Leadership feat. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your squire is always at least three or more levels lower than yourself.<br />A squire can only take levels in a class that grants proficiency with all martial weapons as a class feature, such as paladin, gunslinger, cavalier, or fighter. She cannot multiclass, though she may take any archetype she qualifies for, including the &quot;Squire Archetypes&quot;.<br />If a squire gains enough XP to bring her to two levels lower than your level, the squire does not gain the new level until you gain your next level. Until then her new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance.<br />If you release your squire from service, you may gain a new one by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town where members of your knightly order can typically be found, which requires at least 24 hours of uninterrupted scouting. This act can also replace a squire who has perished.<br />´´´Graduation´´´: When you reach 7th level, this feat automatically upgrades to the Leadership feat (meaning that you effectively lose this feat and replace it with Leadership). You gain all the normal benefits of the Leadership feat, except that your squire must remain at least three levels lower than you and must continue to take levels in her first class. In order for your squire to be able to be two levels lower than you, your squire must be at least 4th level, and you must witness her as she single-handedly defeats a creature with Hit Dice equal to or greater than her own. Upon the creature's defeat, your squire graduates to full knighthood and acts as a normal cohort; she may begin taking levels in other classes if she so chooses, and she may increase in level to up to two levels lower than yourself.|||||||||||21|43|20

Lamashtu's Mark identifies you as favored worshiper of the Mother of Monsters, and if it is visible, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks but a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks.<br />Once per day as a free action, you may invoke Lamashtu's name as you strike a nonevil foe with any melee attack. As you do, you cause the creature struck to become temporarily deformed in some hideous manner. Common deformities caused by this attack include cloven hooves, horns, forked tongues, vestigial limbs like wings and tails, organs inexplicably forming on the outside of the skin, additional (and useless) eyes, and skin that hardens into pus-weeping plates. The deformity reduces the target's Charisma score by 1d4 points for 1 hour; the target can resist this effect by making a Fortitude save (DC 10 + your character level + your Charisma modifier). The physical deformity vanishes as soon as the Charisma penalty fades.<br />In addition, any offspring you sire or give birth to gain the fiendish template.|||||||||||22|44|419

While in swarm form, you are immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as ´´´disintegrate´´´), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by you, which treat you as one single creature if you so choose. While in swarm form, you cannot use any natural attacks or any special attacks, although you gain the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm you transform into.

You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll's immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types.<br />´´´Embalmed Form´´´: This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an ´´´alter self´´´ spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered.

Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed.<br />´´´Positive Energy Immunity´´´: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands.<br />´´´Spell Immunity´´´: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using ´´´spell immunity´´´. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as ´´´greater spell immunity´´´. Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp &times; the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.||||||You may select this feat multiple times.

1134|torchbearer|16||||5||||||Gain the services of a professional torchbearer|You acquire a professional torchbearer to accompany you into the dungeon.|Character level 5th|This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a torchbearer) with this feat, and can't recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your torchbearer is always at least 3 levels lower than your level.<br />A torchbearer can take levels in the alchemist, bard, fighter, ranger, or rogue class. She can't multiclass, though she can take any archetype she qualifies for, including the Torchbearer Archetypes. The torchbearer must take the Torch Handling feat at 1st level.<br />If a torchbearer gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until then her new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance.<br />If you release your torchbearer from service or otherwise lose your torchbearer, you may gain a new one by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town where adventurers are at least somewhat common, which requires 24 hours of uninterrupted scouting.<br />Unlike other hirelings, a torchbearer requires no compensation for her services as long as her employer has this feat; the opportunity to train under a hardened adventurer is reward enough for most torchbearers.<br />´´´Graduation´´´: When you reach 8th level, this feat automatically upgrades to the Leadership feat (meaning that you effectively lose this feat and replace it with Leadership). You gain all the normal benefits of the Leadership feat but lose the benefits of this feat, and your torchbearer acts as a normal cohort; she may begin taking levels in other classes if she so chooses, and may increase in level to up to 2 levels lower than your level.|||||||||||21|49|20

For every kingdom turn in which that follower does nothing but oversee that location, the benefits that building grants to your kingdom's Economy, Fame, Loyalty, and Stability are doubled and any penalties are negated. This feat does not allow a building to grant benefits it does not normally provide, and has no effect on a building's other effects.<br />This feat only applies to one building, and committing multiple followers to this or different buildings has no effect-the selected location is treated as being of particular importance to you, and its uniqueness combined with the follower's loyalty grants it special efficiencies.

To do so, you must have access to the selected spell on a scroll or in a spellbook, and the spell must be on your spell list (even if it is not one of your spells known). This process takes 10 minutes per spell level of the selected spell. You can cast the selected spell a single time, expending the spell slot as though it were a known spell being cast by you. Preparing a spell in this manner expends a scroll but not a spellbook. A spell prepared in this way is considered its actual level rather than the level of the spell slot expended. You can apply metamagic feats to the spell as normal, as long as the spell's actual level plus the increases from metamagic feats is 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a 12th-level sorcerer with this feat, a ´´´scroll of fireball´´´, and the Empower Spell metamagic feat could prepare an ´´´empowered fireball´´´ spell in her 6th-level spell slot.||||||If you spontaneously cast arcane spells, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you spontaneously cast divine spells, you must have a Wisdom score of at least 13 to take this feat.

1473|crisis of conscience|31||||||||||Hide your alignment and loyalties|Your internal struggle and contradictory actions have left you teetering on a knife's edge between good and evil. You must choose which path you will make your own.|Lawful neutral, neutral, or chaotic neutral alignment. Your alignment must have shifted from either good or evil at least once since 1st level or the last time you completed this feat (see Special).|You are an enigma unto those who cleave to notions of morality as guiding life principles. Habits and mannerisms from your past life send subtly confusing signals to those trying to read you. Whenever another character attempts to discern your alignment, loyalties, or intentions (including via magical effects such as ´´´detect thoughts´´´ and when you are using Bluff to send a secret message or feint), you gain a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks and on Will saving throws to resist such effects.|||Resolve your conscience with an act of decisive good or evil that shifts your alignment accordingly. Acts of decisive good include dedicating your worldly wealth to a noble cause or charitable institution, risking death for the sake of others, or another notable sacrifice for a greater good. Acts of decisive evil include reducing a city to penury and starvation, murdering or terrorizing innocents, or other, darker deeds.|If your alignment changes from good to evil or evil to good, you know how to entice others down your path. While you retain this alignment, you gain a +2 bonus on Charisma- and Wisdom-based skill checks made to interact with a sentient creature of your previous (and now opposite) moral alignment. This bonus increases to +4 if success would cause the target to act against its moral alignment (at the GM's discretion). If it does so, you retain this bonus when interacting with that target until its moral alignment is the same as yours.<br />If you return to your original moral alignment, you have gained deeper insight into your convictions. While you retain this moral alignment, you become aware of any action or item that could adversely affect your alignment or your standing with your deity (if you have one), including magical effects. You acquire this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if you take a moment to contemplate the act.||If you've already completed this feat by changing to the opposite moral alignment and have since returned to being morally neutral, you may take this feat a second time. You gain no additional basic benefits, but if you complete this feat's goal a second time by crossing back to your original alignment, you gain additional completion benefits-you gain the second completion benefit, and can apply the first benefit against good and evil creatures.|||||21|69|5

Creating an ooze creature takes 1 day for each 500 gp in its construction cost. To create an ooze, you must have access to an oozing vat, you must use up raw materials worth the construction cost of the ooze, and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 10 + 2 &times; the ooze's CR). A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more also results in an ooze that attacks its creator for 1d4 rounds before dissipating into useless waste material. A newly created ooze has average hit points for its Hit Dice. Oozes created with this feat are mindless and uncontrolled, and even normally intelligent oozes like slithering trackers that are created this way have no Intelligence score-nor any loyalty to their creator.<br />While ooze creatures cannot normally be purchased in traditional marketplaces, GMs who wish to include such an option in their games-perhaps with oozes sold as black market commodities- need only double the construction cost of a specific ooze creature in order to figure out a fair market price.<br />The following table lists some of the most commonly crafted oozes and their creation requirements.

If a special ability is followed by an alignment set in parentheses, you must be able to channel energy capable of healing or harming outsiders of that alignment subtype with Alignment Channel. For example, a cleric must have Alignment Channel (good) to bless a weapon with the ´´´holy´´´ special ability, Alignment Channel (law) to bless a shield with the ´´´vigilant´´´ special ability, and so on. Aligned equipment blessings otherwise follow all the same rules as the equipment blessings granted by Bless Equipment.[[[19]]]|||||||||||21|73|6

To bless a piece of equipment with a particular blessing, you must expend a number of uses of channel energy equal to the number listed in the table above, and your caster level must be equal to or greater than that listed for the selected blessing.<br />This blessing lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice you are capable of dealing or healing with your channel energy ability (for example, the blessing of a cleric capable of channeling 3d6 points of damage would last for 3 rounds), during which time the item is treated as though it possessed the selected special ability. If the piece of equipment belongs to an unwilling creature, that creature may attempt a Will save to prevent the blessing, as if attempting a saving throw against your channel energy ability (so bonuses from channel resistance and similar effects apply); if the creature succeeds at its save, the channeled energy is expended to no effect.<br />Only magical and masterwork weapons, armor, and shields may be blessed with this feat. When you bless a masterwork item, you must expend one additional use of your channel energy ability beyond those normally expended to grant the selected blessing. In addition to the selected blessing, the masterwork item gains a temporary +1 enhancement bonus for the blessing's duration.<br />You can grant a piece of equipment only one blessing at a time.

To use holy water in a particular way, you must meet the additional requirements of that effect, such as a particular feat, ranks in a specific skill, or the ability to cast a certain spell (specified after the effect's name). Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water.<br />´´´Blinding Water´´´ (Improved Precise Shot): By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Reflex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don't rely on vision.<br />´´´Concentrate Holy Water´´´ (Craft [alchemy] 4 ranks): Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperpotent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks of holy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 &times; the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy).<br />A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage &times; the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage &times; the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target.<br />´´´Healing Glyph´´´ (ability to cast ´´´glyph of warding´´´): You can replace the diamond material component in a ´´´glyph of warding´´´ spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, you must place a spell glyph containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead.<br />´´´Healing Water´´´ (Heal 5 ranks): You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage.<br />´´´Holy Circle´´´ (ability to cast ´´´magic circle against evil´´´): You can replace the silver material component of a ´´´magic circle against evil´´´ spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20.<br />´´´Holy Water Splash´´´ (Point-Blank Shot): When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase the damage dealt to creatures within the splash radius of holy water, such as the concentrate holy water ability of this feat or the ´´´empower holy water´´´ spell.|||||||||||21|73|23

Each blessing provides a different special ability drawn from the Bless Equipment list (and the Align Equipment list if you possess that feat). You must still have a high enough caster level to bless a piece of equipment with each of the selected blessings.<br />You expend the appropriate number of uses of channeled energy required for each blessing, taking into account the reduction granted by this feat (and the increase for blessing a masterwork item, if needed). For example, a cleric with this feat would need to expend two uses of channeled energy to bless a weapon with the ´´´undead-bane´´´ and ´´´ghost touch´´´ special abilities (one use for ´´´bane´´´ plus one use for ´´´ghost touch´´´).<br />If a given piece of equipment already has a blessing on it, you can give it a second blessing. When another blessing is applied to a piece of equipment that currently has a blessing active on it, the durations for the two blessings are tracked separately.|||||||||||21|73|7

Instead of the normal effects of successfully hitting with Channel Smite, you may choose the following effect. Starting on your target's next turn, it takes 1d8 points of damage each round at the beginning of its turn. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice you use to roll your channel energy ability. Your target can attempt a Will save each round, as if saving against your channeled energy, to negate the damage dealt to it by this feat on that round. If your initial attack misses, the use of channel energy is still expended with no effect.

Once you have a string of digits, sum them.[[[21]]]If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root.<br />Once you've translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at -1 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell's name when determining the spell's digital root, but they increase the spell's level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check.<br />You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess.<br />For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented ´´´fireball´´´. First, he translates the spell name into numbers. ´´´Fireball´´´ translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of ´´´fireball´´´ is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [´´´fireball´´´'s spell level] + 2 [´´´fireball´´´'s digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the ´´´fireball´´´ this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast ´´´fireball´´´ and perform another action, though he expends the spell.|||||||||||20|74|48

Your numerological abilities are heightened by this uncommon aptitude.|Sacred Geometry; Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks|Anytime you use the Sacred Geometry feat, you can use d8s instead of d6s when rolling your dice pool. You can use any combination of d6s and d8s that you wish, as long as the number of dice does not exceed the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering).|||||||||||20|74|49
1595|sacred geometry|16|4:13||||||||16:2|Add metamagic effects to your spells without using a higher-level spell slot|You can use your mathematical prowess to add metamagic effects to your spells without using a higher-level spell slot.|Int 13; Knowledge (engineering) 2 ranks|When you take this feat, select two metamagic feats you do not yet have. When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability.<br />When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell's effective spell level.<br />Refer to the Prime Constants table below to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot.<br />For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the ´´´magic missile´´´ he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [´´´magic missile´´´'s base level] = 4, so the spell's effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41.<br />Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 &times; 6) + (4 - 3) &times; 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] &times; 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his ´´´empowered enlarged magic missile´´´ takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants. His attempt would have been unsuccessful, and he would have expended a full-round action and his prepared 1st-level ´´´magic missile´´´ spell with no effect.[[[22]]]|||||||||||20|74|49

Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. For the duration of the spell, each summoned creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability scores of the drawn card's suits. If both cards are the same suit, each summoned creature gains a +6 bonus to that ability score instead. If either card's alignment is a true match for the summoned creatures' alignment, the duration of the spell is doubled, while drawing an opposite match halves the duration of the spell. If both a true match and an opposite match are drawn, the spell's duration is unchanged.<br />A creature summoned in this way is distinctly altered by the cards drawn. Its physical appearance reflects the visual elements of the cards (for example, a creature summoned with The Publican might have only one eye). The creature's personality is also influenced by the cards, but not so much as to alter its alignment (for example, The Snakebite might summon a creature that likes to gossip).|||||||||||21|75|14

Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]). Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions.<br />When the spells to be commixed are cast, one is designated as the primary spell (typically the higher level spell), while the other is the secondary spell. The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells' descriptors.<br />Targeted creatures can attempt a saving throw against the primary spell as normal (assuming that a save is normally allowed), and then attempt a separate save against the secondary effect. The secondary effect's save type is described in its listing, and its save DC is equal to the normal save DC of the primary or secondary spell, whichever is lower (or, if neither spell allows a saving throw, 10 + lowest spell's level + spellcaster's primary spellcasting ability score [Int, Wis, or Cha] modifier).<br />Commixed spells cannot be counterspelled normally. A creature with Improved Counterspell can counterspell commixed spells if both spells are correctly identified and both belong to the same school. Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled. Spell resistance still applies to the secondary effect, unless both of the commixed spells bypass spell resistance.'''Synergistic Benefits''': The primary spell's save DC (if any) increases by 1. If either spell is normally modified by Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus, the bonus to save DCs granted by those feats stacks with this increase. The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance.'''Secondary Effects''': While the secondary spell has no direct effect other than bolstering the effects of the primary spell, the combination of spells also creates a unique secondary effect depending on the elemental descriptors of the commixed spells. For the purpose of this secondary effect, the acid, cold, and electricity descriptors count as earth, water, and air descriptors, respectively. Commixed spells with the same elemental descriptors do not produce a secondary effect, though the primary spell still gains the synergistic benefits described above.[[[23]]]||||||An inquisitor or any other character with the solo tactics class feature can use this teamwork feat without the aid of an ally. In order to do so, the character must be able to cast two qualifying spells within the same round, such as by using the Quicken Spell metamagic feat to cast one spell as a swift action or by using effects such as the ´´´time stop´´´ spell.|||||21|77|28

#Champions of Corruption (09.2014)
1756|ally shield|3;34||||||||||Use your allies as shields|You are willing to use your allies as shields to ward off attacks aimed at you.||Whenever you are the target of a melee or ranged attack and are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can initiate this feat to skillfully pull the abettor into harm's way or dodge behind the abettor as an immediate action. You gain cover against that attack (and only that attack). If the attack misses you but would have hit you if not for the cover bonus to your Armor Class, the abettor becomes the target of the attack and the attacker must make a new attack roll (with all the same modifiers) against the abettor's Armor Class.|||||||||||21|85|20
1757|callous casting|3;34|||||||||31:1|Include allies in the area of your spells to dishearten your enemies|You don't care if your allies are harmed by your spells. The smart ones know this and start running.|Spellcraft 1 rank|You initiate this feat by including an abetting ally in the area of any spell that deals damage of a type to which the abettor is not immune. The callousness of the attack disheartens foes in the area, who must succeed at a Will save against the spell's DC or be shaken for 1 round per spell level. After you resolve the spell's effects, the abettor can move up to her speed as an immediate action. Any movement undertaken using this action is then subtracted from her speed until the end of her next turn. This movement can still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. Once a foe has attempted a Will save against this feat, he is immune to this effect from that initiator for 24 hours thereafter.|||||||||||21|85|20
1758|chairbreaker|6||16|||||1|||Break improvised weapons to deal more damage|You deal more damage by breaking nearby objects against your enemies.|Catch Off-Guard; base attack bonus +1|When you attack a target with an improvised weapon, you can give that weapon the broken condition to deal 1d4 points of additional damage on that attack. Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus on the roll to confirm a critical hit with this attack. If you confirm the crit, the extra damage granted by this feat is also multiplied and the improvised weapon is destroyed.|||||||||||21|85|23
1759|craft shadow piercing|19||||||||0:5|5:5|Learn to craft magical piercings infused with shadow|You can craft magical piercings infused with the power of shadow.|Caster level 5th: Craft (jewelry) 5 ranks|You can create special wondrous items-typically barbs, hooks, rings, and spikes-that adorn piercings in the wearer's flesh and grant magical abilities. Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process.<br />Shadow piercings must be placed in a part of the body normally associated with a magic item slot, but they do not take up a slot on the body, nor interfere with other magic items that use those slots. A single slot can only hold one shadow piercing (nonmagical piercings do not count against this limit). Shadow piercings can be applied to the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, and wrist.<br />A single slot can hold multiple physical piercings, though the pieces of jewelry operate as a single item and must be created for that purpose. Shadow piercings have different levels of power: minor, major, and greater. Minor shadow piercings usually include one piece of jewelry, while major and greater shadow piercings often are made up of multiple rings and spikes that cover the entire area of the piercing's slot (but are still considered a single item). A creature can only use a number of shadow piercings equal its Constitution modifier plus its Wisdom modifier.<br />Carefully inserting or removing a shadow piercing takes a full-round action and deals no damage. Alternatively, a shadow piercing may be pulled out of a creature using the steal maneuver as a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage. Only a creature with the Craft Shadow Piercing feat may create or insert a shadow piercing, but any creature may remove one. Inserting a shadow piercing is impossible unless the target is willing or helpless. After being removed, a shadow piercing may be inserted into another creature by someone with this feat. Since they are treated as magic items, they are affected by ´´´dispel magic´´´.<br />Shadow piercings follow the rules for magic item creation, except the creator can use the Craft (jewelry) skill instead of Spellcraft. New shadow piercings can be researched and designed using the rules for pricing new magic items. Shadow piercing powers for a specific slot must be thematically similar or linked. Since shadow piercings don't interfere with other magic items in the same slot, but can only have one piercing per slot, the base price is multiplied by 1.5 instead of doubled as if they had no space limitation.|||||||||||21|85|28
1760|destructive persuasion|6||122|||||||13:1|Smash objects to gain bonuses on Intimidate|Sometimes, you have to break things if you want people to get your point.|Power Attack; Intimidate 1 rank|As a standard action, you can attempt to smash an unattended inanimate object while attempting an Intimidate check (see Smashing an Object, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 173). If you break the object, you gain a bonus to the Intimidate check equal to half its hardness (minimum +1). If you destroy the object, the bonus is equal to its hardness (minimum +1). Creatures intimidated by this feat cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.|||||||||||21|85|23
1761|fiendskin|11||||||||||Gain defensive abilities related to your patron's outsider subtype|The forces of darkness gird you against the light.||You gain defensive abilities related to your patron's outsider subtype. For example, if your patron is a devil, the abilities listed below tie into the devil subtype. These benefits tie to your patron's subtype, not your specific patron (its abilities might differ from the norm).<br />´´´One Damnation Feat´´´: Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type.<br />´´´Two Damnation Feats´´´: Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type. If you already have resistance to the chosen energy type (even from earlier benefits of this feat), this new resistance stacks with the existing resistance.<br />´´´Three Damnation Feats´´´: Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain immunity to the selected energy type.<br />´´´Four Damnation Feats´´´: Your creature type changes to outsider (native). Additionally, choose one energy type to which your patron's outsider subtype grants immunity or resistance. You gain immunity to that energy type.|||||||||||21|85|16
1762|friendly fire|3;34||123||||||||Increase your ability to attack in ranged combat by not caring if you hit your allies|Your ranged attacks startle your enemies, partly because you're not even trying to avoid hitting your allies.|Precise Shot|You initiate this feat as a standard action, making a ranged attack against a foe engaged in melee with at least one abettor. This shot deliberately forsakes normal precautions, putting your abettor at risk, but also is unexpected enough to surprise your mutual opponent. You gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll if the attack passes through an abettor's space. If your shot misses the target, you must immediately make a second attack roll with all the same modifiers against the abettor, potentially hitting her with the attack instead of the opponent. When the attack resolves (regardless of whether either potential target was hit), the intended target's startled reaction provokes an attack of opportunity from the abettor.|||||||||||21|85|21
1763|maleficium|11||||||||||Cast evil spells with increased potency|You are a master of dark magic.||You cast spells with the evil descriptor with increased potency.<br />´´´One Damnation Feat´´´: Add 1 to the DCs of all saving throws against spells with the evil descriptor that you cast.<br />´´´Two Damnation Feats´´´: When you apply a metamagic feat to a spell with the evil descriptor, that spell takes up a spell slot 1 level lower than normal (to a minimum of 1 level above the spell's actual level).<br />´´´Three Damnation Feats´´´: Add 1 to the DCs of all saving throws against spells with the evil descriptor that you cast. This bonus stacks with the earlier benefits of this feat.<br />´´´Four Damnation Feats´´´: Treat your caster level as being 2 higher for all level-dependent effects of spells with the evil descriptor that you cast.|||||||||||21|85|17
1764|mask of virtue|11||||||||||Mask your true alignment|Your alignment is known to you and you alone.||Those who try to learn your true alignment find it hidden or receive a false result. Depending on the number of damnation feats you possess, spells or special abilities that would normally reveal your alignment return a vague or incorrect result. If this feat disguises your alignment, you can use either your true alignment or the false one when using magic items with alignment prerequisites.<br />´´´One Damnation Feat´´´: The spell or special ability returns an inconclusive result.<br />´´´Two Damnation Feats´´´: Upon gaining this power, choose an alignment within one step of your actual alignment. Your alignment is always revealed as being that false alignment.<br />´´´Three Damnation Feats´´´: Upon gaining this power, choose an alignment within two steps of your actual alignment. Your alignment is always revealed as being this false alignment.<br />´´´Four Damnation Feats´´´: You immediately know when someone is attempting to use a spell or special ability to learn your alignment. You learn the name and alignment of the creature using the effect. Additionally, you can choose any alignment as the result returned by the spell or ability.|||||||||||21|85|17
1765|reckless moves|3;34|||||||||1:3|Use an ally as a counterweight to improve your balance|You and your teammates push and pull each other to maintain your balance in precarious circumstances.|Acrobatics 3 ranks|If you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can initiate this feat as a free action to use the ally as a counterweight to improve your balance, which requires you to push or pull her slightly. You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks until you cease using this feat as a free action or you move away from the ally. The abettor is kept off balance and takes a -2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks as long as this feat remains in effect. You can initiate this feat as an immediate action while you are falling or being knocked prone in order to switch places with the abettor, moving her into your former space and moving yourself into her former space. If you do, you and the abettor each end this movement prone unless you succeed at an Acrobatics check with a DC of 20 (the bonuses and penalties for this feat apply). If you were falling, the abettor is falling instead. If you or the abettor were climbing, the other person must succeed at a Climb check against the surface's normal DC to grab on and avoid falling. Switching places provokes attacks of opportunity for the abettor only.|||||||||||21|85|21
1766|shrapnel strike|6|1:15|93||||||||Gain a bonus to break objects which can shatter|You can bash things to damage nearby opponents.|Str 15; Improved Sunder|When you attempt a Strength check to break an object that can shatter (nothing made of paper, cloth, leather, or other soft, pliable material), you gain a bonus on the Strength check equal to your base attack bonus. If you surpass the object's break DC, you can send shards of its material flying out in all directions, dealing an amount of piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus 1 point per point of the object's hardness to all creatures within 10 feet of the object, including yourself. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) halves the damage.|||||||||||21|85|23
1767|soulless gaze|11||||||||||Use Intimidate with greater proficiency|Otherworldly dread infuses your gaze.||You can use the Intimidate skill to manipulate and terrify others.<br />´´´One Damnation Feat´´´: You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.<br />´´´Two Damnation Feats´´´: When you demoralize a creatures more than once using Intimidate, you can create stronger fear conditions rather than increasing the duration of the shaken condition.<br />´´´Three Damnation Feats´´´: You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks (this stacks with the earlier benefits of this feat).<br />´´´Four Damnation Feats´´´: You can use Intimidate to demoralize opponents as a swift action.|||||||||||21|85|17
1768|splash volley|3;34|||||||1|||Allies can help to redirect missed splash weapons nearby|Your allies are used to being in the splash zone of your hurled weapons, and try to ensure that at least your opponent gets hit.|Base attack bonus +1|You initiate this feat whenever you throw a splash weapon into a square within the reach of an ally who also has this feat and miss your target. Rather than you rolling to see where the weapon lands, the abettor can try to redirect it as an immediate action by making a melee touch attack against any adjacent foe. If the abettor's attack hits that foe, the splash weapon impacts in the nearest square the targeted foe occupies.|||||||||||21|85|21
1769|stunning irruption|6|1:15|122|||||5|||Stun your opponents by breaking through objects|When you smash your way into a room, you gain more than just the element of surprise.|Str 15; Power Attack; base attack bonus +5|Before starting combat, you can attempt to break through a door, window, or wall to enter a room. If you succeed, the violence of your arrival is so great that all characters within 20 feet of your entry point must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be stunned instead of acting in the surprise round (if there is one) plus 1 round thereafter. Characters who succeed at this save are instead shaken for 1d4 rounds.|||||||||||21|85|23

When summoning a creature from this list, your debased nature allows you to cast the spell as a standard action. The summoned creature appears as normal for the spell but can't act until next your next turn. It is not flat-footed, however, and it can make attacks of opportunity as normal. These effects don't apply for creatures from the standard list that aren't also on this list.||||||If you possess the Sacred Summons feat, you can apply it to a creature on this list whose alignment (as opposed to its subtype or subtypes) matches your aura.[[[24]]]|||||21|85|33

When you choose to use this feat, check the results of your attack roll against both your opponent's AC and your ally's AC. If you hit your opponent, you deal bonus damage as though you were using Power Attack. If you hit your ally, the ally takes no damage from your attack except this bonus damage. It is possible to hit both your enemy and your abettor with one attack. Extra damage from this feat stacks with Power Attack.|||||||||||21|85|21

1972|esoteric abjuration|12||||||||||Your abjuration spells give the target a +1 competence bonus to a single saving throw for the duration of the spell|A carefully selected set of geodes causes the defenses you create with your spells to offer even better protection.||When you cast an abjuration spell using geodes as an esoteric material component, you can grant a single target of that spell a +1 competence bonus on its Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throws for the duration of the spell. The spell must have a duration measured in rounds or minutes, and a creature can benefit from no more than one bonus from this feat at a time.<br />When you gain geodes' greater component effect with an abjuration spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining the duration.|||||||||||11|96|154

For 1 round, that creature hasn't fully phased onto the current plane, causing all attacks against it to suffer a 20% miss chance (attacks without attack rolls deal 20% less damage).<br />When you gain prismatic sand's greater component effect with a conjuration spell, treat your caster level as an additional 2 higher for determining the range. This happens regardless of whether you chose to increase range or area with the greater component effect. This feat does not allow you to further increase the size of an area.|||||||||||11|96|154

If your spell allows a saving throw and the target succeeds at its save, it doesn't take this penalty. A creature can be affected by only one penalty from this feat at a time.

If your spell allows a saving throw and the target succeeds at its save, it is unaffected by this effect. If the spell causes the target to become shaken or frightened, this effect doesn't increase the severity of that condition (so a spell that frightens a creature wouldn't instead cause it to become panicked due to this feat). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br />When you gain entropic resin's greater component effect with a necromancy spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining the damage dice.

If the creature is still in tattoo form at the end of that time, the tattoo disappears, the creature is sent back to the plane from which it was summoned, and the remaining duration of the summon is wasted. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can cause the creature to change from a tattoo back into creature form, and appear in a square adjacent to you. The remaining duration of the spell is then expended as normal. The creature is staggered for 1 round after emerging from tattoo form. This is a supernatural ability.|||||||||||21|101|14

When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6th-level hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage).<br />One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast.<br />If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast).<br />The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier.|||||||||||12|102|135

In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using ´´´dispel magic´´´. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability's effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon's breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon's effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again.|||||||||||12|102|136

The allies don't need to have the metamagic feat you choose to apply, and the effective level of the spell (after applying the metamagic feat) can't be higher than the highest level of spells you can cast. Lastly, when you use this ability, the spell each ally readies is lost, as if they had cast that spell.|||||||||||20|105|206

If the ally has a Skill Focus feat, you also count as having that feat for the purpose of the following skill uses: Acrobatics checks to move through threatened squares, Bluff checks to feint, Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple, Intimidate checks to demoralize, Knowledge checks to identify a monster, and Perception checks to notice a creature using Stealth. Furthermore, if the ally has a weapon proficiency gained through the ancestral arms racial trait, you also count as having that weapon proficiency.|||||||||||20|105|207

You become the target of the attack, and the opponent gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll. For the purpose of determining distance, cover and concealment, you count as being in your ally's square when the attack is resolved. If the attack misses you due to concealment, ´´´blink´´´, or a similar effect, it instead targets your ally as if you had not used this feat's ability.|||||||||||20|105|207

Your shapes occasionally appear to blend into each other, making it impossible to distinguish you and granting you and any affected allies a 20% miss chance due to concealment. This is an illusion (figment) effect.<br />Spells and effects that don't require an attack roll, such as area spells, affect you normally. An attacker must be able to see and reach both you and your ally to be fooled. If you're invisible or the attacker is blind, the feat has no effect. Because this feat relies on the fact that both you and your ally are blending together to create the visual illusion, it doesn't function with effects like the inquisitor's solo tactics class feature; both you and the ally must possess the feat. If you have more than one adjacent ally with this feat, this feat applies to all allies who qualify.|||||||||||20|105|207

Both you and your ally must be within 30 feet of the target, and you must be able to trace a line from any part of your space to any part of your ally's space so that the line passes through the target's space.

If anyone in your group instead plans to use the parley to gain a combat advantage, the opponents can attempt a Sense Motive check against each such member of your group to get a hunch, with a DC equal to either 20 or the result of that character's Bluff check, whichever is higher.||||||If the parley would inherently result in the opponents surrendering or losing, if the opponents are mind-controlled or fanatics, or if there are other appropriate circumstances at the GM's discretion, you might not be able to use this feat. For instance, if the opponents' main advantage over your group comes from a short-duration spell that would end during a parley (see Calling for a Cease-Fire rules), you cannot use this feat. Circumstances could potentially increase the check's DC by 5, 10, or even up to 20.|||||13|114|79

If you exceed the DC by 10, you gain a description of some location within 50 miles, and if you succeed the DC by 20, you gain a description of some location within 25 miles. Once you have attempted such a check for a specific location, you cannot attempt it again, and if you attempt to use ´´´greater teleport´´´ elsewhere in the same general area, the result is the same. For instance, if you don't know the location of the villain's castle, you also don't know a location within 100 miles of the stables next to the villain's castle, or within 100 miles of the town half a mile away from the villain's castle.|||||||||||13|114|79

The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.<br />If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing. Since you are concealing the spell's manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you're doing something, even if they don't realize you're casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your loud, clear voice but don't notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can't use readied actions that depend on realizing that you're casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you're casting. Spells such as ´´´fireball´´´ that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you.<br />If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you're behaving unusually.|||||||||||13|114|80

You use this maneuver in melee to sabotage an item that is neither held nor hidden in a bag, pack, or other container. You must have at least one hand free to perform this combat maneuver, and doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature against whom you are performing the maneuver, even though you have the Improved Sunder feat.<br />When attempting the combat maneuver check, use your ranks in Disable Device in place of your base attack bonus and your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier. Any bonuses on combat maneuver checks specifically to sunder (such as the bonus granted by Improved Sunder) also apply to this maneuver, and any bonuses your target gains to CMD against sundering attempts also protect her from this maneuver. If you succeed at the check, instead of dealing damage, you sabotage the chosen item, causing it to gain the broken condition. If the item was already broken, you instead destroy the item or cause it to fall off. Items immune to sunder are also immune to this special combat maneuver, and this still can't destroy or remove an item such as an artifact that can normally be destroyed or removed only by specific means.|A successful sunder attempt deals weapon damage to the sundered item.||||||||||13|114|90

The DC equals 20, or 10 + the target's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, you learn whether or not a falsehood of your choice related to the topic of conversation would impose a penalty on Bluff checks to convince the target of that falsehood's truth. If you fail by 4 or less, you learn nothing. If you fail by 5 or more, the target realizes you are trying to glean information from it. You can retry this check, but the DC increases by 5 for each previous failure on this check against that target.|||||||||||13|114|91

If you don't understand the language they are speaking, you take a -5 penalty on the check, and if the creatures are a different type than you, you take an additional -5 penalty on the check.<br />If you succeed at this check by 5 or more, for the next hour, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to lie about one of the creatures to the other and on Diplomacy checks to request that one act against the other.

When you move through the target's space, you must attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to 10 + your opponent's CMD. Success allows you to move through the target's space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that target, and when you arrive in the destination space and make your attack, the target is considered flanked for that attack (or the first attack if you have more than one attack on a charge). On a failed check, you instead provoke an attack of opportunity and complete the charge as normal. Whether or not you succeed at the Acrobatics check, you take a -4 penalty to your AC until the start of your turn, instead of the normal -2 penalty.|When charging, you must end the movement part of a charge in the closest space in which you can attack your target.||||||||||13|114|91

If you hit, you deal your precise strike damage as normal against this enemy. When using the swashbuckler's precise strike deed, you can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to deal your regular precise strike damage on a single attack against an opponent that would typically be immune. If you have both class features, you can use either option in order to apply the full damage from both versions of precise strike.<br />Additionally, against opponents with a chance of immunity to your precise strike (such as an opponent wearing armor with the ´´´fortification´´´ special ability), this feat reduces their chance of negating your precise strikes by 10%.|||||||||||13|114|92

The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the creature's CR based on its race and not including any class levels or template (a creature that is defined by class levels has an effective CR of 0 for this ability). If you succeed, your studied spell ignores any energy resistance or damage reduction the target has because of its race as well as any bonuses on saving throws against the spell granted by the target's race (such as the bonus from a dwarf 's hardy ability or a halfling's halfling luck ability). Your studied spell doesn't ignore energy resistance, damage reduction, or saving throw bonuses granted by other spells and effects.

The Knowledge (arcana) DC to identify a stylized spell, its effects, or the materials it creates is 10 higher than normal, as is the DC to recognize your magical signature with ´´´greater detect magic´´´.<br />When you apply this feat to a spell, you can attempt to disguise your stylized spell as another spell of the same school and subschool with the same descriptors. The other spell must be either the same spell level as the stylized spell (before applying the metamagic adjustment) or 1 spell level higher. If you do so, the stylized spell gains the ruse descriptor and takes on some superficial aspects of the other spell. As usual for a spell with the ruse descriptor, identification attempts that fail by 10 or less mistakenly identify it as the chosen spell (those that fail by more can't identify it at all).

At this point, you can either use your telepathy ability or spend a use or casting of ´´´detect thoughts´´´ as an immediate action. If you do so, for every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, you glean one fragment of information about the communication, such as the identity of its source; its general nature; the emotional state of the sender or the recipient; or a specific person, place, or thing mentioned in the message. In addition, the creature must attempt a saving throw (with a DC equal to that of the spell if you spent a use of ´´´detect thoughts´´´ or are using ´´´telepathy´´´, or 10 + 1/2 your racial HD + your Charisma modifier if you are using a racial telepathy ability).

Additionally, by meditating and inflicting strenuous reckonings upon yourself, you unlock the power behind your order's doctrine. Each Hellknight order has its own unique reckoning-a trial of obedience and pain. When coupled with the necessary reflection and meditation, this reckoning takes 1 hour per day to perform. Once you have performed your order's reckoning, you gain the benefit of a special ability as indicated in the Reckoning entry for the Hellknight order to which you've sworn allegiance.<br />If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by the Hellknight order. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the Hellknight order's second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the Hellknight order's third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed in a boon's description, the boon's effects are constant.<br />If you ever fail to perform a daily reckoning, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the reckoning.<br />You can take this feat only if you are associated with a Hellknight order, whether you're in training to become a Hellknight, already a member, or otherwise aligned with the order-the specifics are left to you and the GM to determine. Once per year, you can change your Hellknight allegiance, but doing so requires the approval of the Hellknight order you wish to join. If you are ever cast out of the Hellknight order to which you've sworn allegiance, you lose the benefits of this feat until you restore yourself in the Hellknights' esteem.

Once during the next 24 hours, you can draw upon this focus to gain the benefits of any one of the following effects. To activate the ability, you must deal 1 point of lethal damage to yourself as a swift action (unless otherwise noted). Members of the Order of the Nail often install a sharp barb within their armor that deals this damage when the wearer is subject to a critical hit; if you're struck by a critical hit while wearing such armor, using this ability doesn't require a swift action.<br />´´´Fervor´´´: The DCs to resist the effects of the boons granted by your Hellknight Obedience feat increase by 1 for 1 hour.<br />´´´Indomitability´´´: You can reroll a single failed Will saving throw and must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.

If the creature is attempting to conceal its loyalties, it attempts a Bluff check. If the result of the Bluff check is higher than 20, that result becomes the DC of your Sense Motive check. On a success, you learn whether the creature has a patron god, a witch patron, or a government to which it is strongly loyal.

You must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 5 + twice the CR of the undead creature or haunt. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you receive a +2 bonus on this saving throw. If you succeed, you harbor the undead or haunt's essence, and it cannot continue to rejuvenate or manifest until you release it.

If you succeed, you take 1 point of Constitution and Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce this ability damage, nor can the ability damage be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit. You can release the spirit at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit returns to its former location and begins rejuvenating or manifesting again as normal. If you die from the Constitution damage, the spirit is released, and if you become comatose from the Wisdom damage, the spirit gains control of your body (and can release itself whenever it desires).||||||If you are using the sanity system and fail your Constitution check while harboring the spirit, you take sanity damage equal to 1/2 the spirit's CR (minimum 1) instead of 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

Your spirit bonus is +1, or equal to your spirit bonus from any medium class levels you have (whichever is higher). You don't select a taboo and the spirit gains no influence over you. You can continue to gain the benefits of the spiritual possession for up to 1 hour per character level you have. At the end of the duration, the spirit takes over your body, and you become an NPC under the GM's control for a duration equal to the amount of time the spirit possessed you. You can end the duration prematurely as a free action, but the spirit still takes over your body. If you have the spirit class feature, you can't use this feat and act as a vessel for a second spirit simultaneously, but you gain spirit powers as normal for your medium level.||||||You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, you gain a new spirit you can channel.|||||21|125|24

An imbued weapon damages incorporeal creatures as though it were magical. If the imbued weapon has an enhancement bonus of +2 or greater, it functions as a ´´´ghost touch´´´ weapon.

This benefit stacks with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. When you are unconscious, paralyzed, asleep, or stunned, your possessed hand can still act on your behalf in a limited fashion. The hand uses your statistics when performing any action in this manner. The hand can't take attacks of opportunity, but can draw attacks of opportunity from actions it takes. The hand can perform the following actions each turn on your initiative count.[[[42]]]|||||||||||21|125|24

Removing or reattaching your possessed hand is a full-round action. This deals no damage to you, but you can't use the hand while it is removed. The hand acts as a wizard's familiar, using your character level as your effective wizard level, except it doesn't gain the alertness, share spells, deliver touch spells, spell resistance, or scry on familiar abilities. Use the statistics for a crawling hand to represent the detached hand, save that the hand isn't undead, doesn't have the mark quarry ability, and shares your alignment. If the hand is destroyed, the spirit regenerates your missing hand in 2d4 days. This process can be accelerated by ´´´regenerate´´´ or similar magic. You cannot use the Possessed Hand feat or any feat with the Possessed Hand feat as a prerequisite until the hand is fully regenerated.<br />If you have the familiar class feature, you can choose for your possessed hand to become your familiar, granting it all familiar abilities as normal. If selected as a familiar, your possessed hand grants you a +3 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.|||||||||||21|125|24

2659|haunt scavenger|19||||||||||Syphon ectoplasm from haunts to use in crafting magic items|You can use spiritual essence to craft magic items.|Any one item creation feat or Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks|You can harvest the ectoplasmic remains of haunts, incorporeal undead, or the like to craft magic items. Whenever you encounter a recently neutralized haunt, the remains of an incorporeal undead creature, or the remains of a creature that has the ability to possess another creature using a racial spell-like ability or supernatural ability (such as a ghost or a shadow demon), you can attempt to extract material components from those remains that are suitable for crafting magic items. You must have access to an alchemist's lab in order to extract components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these components within 10 minutes of the haunt or creature's death or destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you.<br />Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature).<br />Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted.<br />Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell's normal material components. Additionally, they can be used in place of actual gold to fund the construction of a magic item with an enchantment or necromancy aura.|||||||||||21|125|30

It possesses your hand, guiding and aiding you in exchange for help in return.||You attract a ghost, spirit, or outsider with personal motivations to possess your hand. This usually involves some sort of mutually beneficial pact or agreement. Your possessed hand helps you in numerous ways, but its periodic, uncontrolled antics are distracting; you take a permanent -2 penalty on concentration checks once you gain this feat.<br />Any attack you make with a one-handed weapon, light weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack with your possessed hand gains a +1 insight bonus on the attack roll and damage roll. You also gain a +1 insight bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks. Once per day as a swift action, you can retrieve any stowed object you carry on your person, provided the object weighs no more than 5 pounds.|||||||||||21|125|25

When you use this ability, you must target one creature within 30 feet to which you have line of sight. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates the effects of this feat.<br />An incorporeal undead creature that fails its save against this effect is staggered. If you target a possessed creature, the possessing entity must succeed at a Will save to resist being staggered for 1 round. If it is staggered, the creature it possesses can immediately attempt a new saving throw to end the possession effect (possession effects that don't allow saving throws to resist them cannot be ended by Rahadoumi Exorcist, but the feat can still stagger a possessed creature). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.|||||||||||21|125|7

You can present this offering to a nonhumanoid creature (even one which doesn't normally consume food) as a standard action. The offering's ingredients must be worth at least 5 gp &times; the creature's CR. This offering improves its attitude toward you by one step unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Wisdom modifier). This attitude adjustment lasts only 5 minutes unless the creature's attitude is adjusted further during that time, such as via the Diplomacy skill.

The possessing creature can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier) to halve the damage.

While dominated or possessed, you can attempt a Will save as a swift action to temporarily regain control over your body. On a successful save, you can act normally for 1 round.

As a standard action, you can spend up to 1 vigor point per 3 Hit Dice you have (minimum 1) to regain 1d6 hit points per vigor point spent (maximum 7d6). Each time you spend vigor points, you become fatigued for 1 minute. You cannot spend vigor points while fatigued or exhausted. Spending vigor points doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The points in your vigor pool are replenished to their maximum after you rest for 8 hours.|||||||||||21|134|14

This metamagic feat can be applied to only cure spells; ´´´breath of life´´´; or any harmless spell that can be used to remove ability score damage, ability score drain, or a negative condition or effect (including ´´´break enchantment´´´, ´´´neutralize poison´´´, and ´´´remove disease´´´). When you cast a contingent spell, you must set a specific trigger that dictates under what circumstances the target is immediately subject to the spell's effects (for instance, &quot;When the target dies, ´´´breath of life´´´ takes effect&quot;). The contingent spell's effects can remain dormant within the target for up to 10 minutes per caster level you have. A creature can be infused with only one contingent spell at a time.<br />A contingent spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.|||||||||||21|134|14

For instance, if a 4th-level oracle of life with the spirit boost revelation heals a 4th-level fighter with this feat, up to 6 points of healing could become temporary hit points for the fighter (the oracle's caster level + 1/2 the fighter's level).|||||||||||21|134|15

If you do, the spell gains the evil and pain descriptors. The target takes nonlethal damage equal to the number of hit points restored. If the target fails its saving throw or chooses not to attempt one against your healing spell, it takes a -2 penalty on saving throws and skill checks for 10 minutes per caster level. If the spell does not normally allow a saving throw, it instead allows a Fortitude saving throw to negate this penalty (but not the nonlethal damage dealt).|||||||||||21|134|8

Whenever you spend vigor points, you can recover from 1d3 points of ability score damage from one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) instead of regaining 1d6 hit points. You can choose separately for each vigor point spent. For example, if you spend 2 vigor points, you could regain 2d6 hit points; recover 2d3 points of ability damage from up to two physical ability scores total; or regain 1d6 hit points and recover from 1d3 points of ability damage from one physical ability score.|||||||||||21|134|15

2902|||||||||||||You completely eschew your former identity, making you impossible to locate or even name.||A character with this feat eschews all of her former identities, going as far as to render her former name completely inaccessible by mortal means. You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places. (For example, you could adopt the title &quot;Blue Fox&quot; or &quot;Night Stalker,&quot; but not the title &quot;Chelish Avenger&quot; or &quot;Spirit of the Mwangi.&quot;)<br />At the ritual's conclusion, you must don the mask created for the ritual, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally.<br />As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you independent of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC of 10 + your hit dice. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the ´´´named bullet´´´ spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this benefit is not magical for the purpose of ´´´dispel magic´´´ and other effects).

You circle around that path until your next turn, and this movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You are considered to be in every space along the path for the purpose of threatening squares and providing flanking for other allies (but not yourself), as well as whether you are in the area of an area effect. Other creatures can attack you (and touch you with beneficial touch spells) as if you were in every space along the path.

2938|murky spell|22||||||||||Cloud effects work underwater, with penalties|You can call upon murky sediments in the water to transform a mist spell underwater.||You can apply Murky Spell only to a mist or fog spell that normally doesn't work underwater, such as ´´´cloudkill´´´, ´´´fog cloud´´´, ´´´mind fog´´´, ´´´obscuring mist´´´, or ´´´solid fog´´´. When cast underwater, a murky spell clouds the water with sediments, producing roughly the same effects as the normal spell would above water except as follows. Due to the dilution, a murky spell has only one-tenth of the duration of a normal spell (generally 1 minute per level, though ´´´mind fog´´´ lasts 3 minutes), but this reduction doesn't affect the duration of secondary effects like mind fog's mental penalties. Abilities that see through mist and fog can't see through a murky spell unless they also specifically see through murky water (like the mistsight universal monster rule). Instead of wind, currents can disperse a murky spell; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a murky spell in 1 round. A murky spell has no effect above the water. A murky spell uses up a slot the same spell level as the spell's actual level.|||||||||||21|143|58

This works similarly to the charge action, except you can move only straight up, and you make a single piercing unarmed strike or bite attack. If the attack hits, it deals double damage; if the attack roll's result is also higher than 11 + the target's Swim modifier, the attack knocks the target off-balance until its next turn. Like with a charge, you can perform a partial version when limited to a single standard action (such as in the surprise round); in addition to moving half as far as normal for a partial charge, the attack doubles only the damage dice (as per Vital Strike) rather than the full damage roll.|||||||||||21|143|58

Suppressing the spells requires you to roll 1d20 + your character level; the DC for each spell is 11 + the spell's caster level (if the spells affecting the creature have differing caster levels, you might dispel some but not the others).

A poppet familiar has Craft, Perception, Profession, and Stealth as class skills. A poppet familiar cannot receive augmentations from crafting, but its connection to you allows it to spontaneously generate augmentations of your choice as you increase in level.<br />If your caster level is 5th or higher, your poppet familiar either becomes Small in size or gains two augmentations of your choice. You do not need to meet the requirements (or pay the construction cost) to craft these augmentations.

At caster level 9th and every 2 caster levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6 (to a maximum of 7d6 at 19th level). A poppet can use this breath weapon three times per day.<br />If your poppet familiar is lost or destroyed, you can replace it with another standard Tiny poppet that you control by undertaking a ritual that takes 8 hours to complete.

The spell gains the water descriptor, and you can either replace the spell's normal damage with bludgeoning damage or split the spell's damage so that half is bludgeoning and half is of its normal type. Creatures with damage reduction apply their damage reduction to bludgeoning damage from a benthic spell, but the spell counts as bludgeoning and magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.<br />A benthic spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.|||||||||||21|147|14

You gain DR/piercing equal to the spell's level for 1 round after you finish casting the spell. After this round, the water collapses into a briny puddle and the effect ends.

The soul can be captured in any way (the spells ´´´create soul gem´´´, ´´´soul trap´´´, and ´´´trap the soul´´´ are the most common methods), but you must be able to touch the soul or the object in which it is trapped (usually a crystal or gem) to use it as a material component. Using a soul in this way does not harm the object in which it was trapped. The soul itself must be at least equal in value to the gp cost of the material component you are replacing (any excess gp value is lost). See below for the gp values of various souls.<br />A soul used as a material component is damaged but not destroyed. Once used, such a soul is no longer trapped and cannot be used as a material component again. A creature whose soul has been used as a material component cannot be restored to life via ´´´raise dead´´´. ´´´Reincarnate´´´, ´´´resurrection´´´, and ´´´true resurrection´´´ can restore such a creature to life if the caster succeeds at a DC 20 caster level check. ´´´Miracle´´´ and ´´´wish´´´ can restore the creature to life without requiring a caster level check.

So long as a latent curse remains active in an item, you cannot recover the spell slot used to cast that spell. A latent curse remains active in an item for 1 day per caster level, but you can dispel the latent curse whenever you recover your spells as a free action, rending the cursed object harmless and regaining the expended spell slot.<br />A latent curse spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.|||||||||||21|150|20

Once you decide how many rounds the potion's effects will be delayed by, that decision cannot later be changed. When a delayed potion is imbibed, it has no effect for the chosen number of rounds, and then it affects the imbiber as normal. The rounds in which the potion's effects are delayed do not count against the duration of the potion's effect. A spell brewed into a potion this way does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.|||||||||||21|154|16

When imbibed, the potion has the effect of both the chosen cure spell and the spell used to brew the potion. When brewing the potion, you must expend both spells as though you were creating two separate potions. Due to the intricacies of making such a carefully blended potion, you must use particularly fine and rare ingredients, meaning you must pay twice the cost of creating each potion separately. The combined spell levels of the cure spell and the other spell used in the potion must be level 3 or less (for example, you could combine ´´´cure light wounds´´´ with a 2nd-level spell to create a healing potion, or ´´´cure moderate wounds´´´ with a 1st-level spell, or ´´´cure serious wounds´´´ with a 0-level spell).|||||||||||21|154|16

This does not stack with any other effect that would increase the duration of the potion, such as the Extend Spell metamagic feat. A spell brewed into a potion this way uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for the purposes of crafting and its cost.|||||||||||21|154|17

3189|vaporous potion|16||15||||||||You can create potions that expand into a gas|You know how to brew potions that can be delivered as a gaseous cloud.|Brew Potion|When you brew a potion, you can brew it in such a way that when exposed suddenly to air and force, it diffuses into a cloud of vapor that can be inhaled. The potion can still be consumed normally, but it can also be delivered by throwing it at another creature as a splash weapon. The potion vial has a range increment of 10 feet and is considered an improvised weapon. On impact, the vial breaks and a cloud of barely visible potion vapor fills the square it lands in (this vapor does not obscure normal sight in any way). If a creature is in that square, it gains the benefits of the potion immediately as though it had imbibed the potion.<br />Otherwise, the vapor persists for 1d3+1 rounds in only that square before dissipating, and the first creature to enter the square before the vapor dissipates gains the potion's benefits. A creature entering the vapor's space can hold its breath to refrain from inhaling the potion. No more than one creature can benefit from a potion's vapor, and if more than one creature is in the potion's space after it is thrown, the potion is wasted and has no effect. The thrown potion deals no damage to creatures or objects it hits. A spell brewed into a potion this way does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.|||||||||||21|154|17

Once struck, the target is both exposed to your nagaji poison as normal and entangled. An entangled target can break free from the sticky goo with a successful DC 15 Strength or Escape Artist check as a full-round action or by dealing 15 points of damage to the gooey substance with a slashing weapon.

This creates a ´´´forbiddance´´´ effect, using your character level as your caster level (maximum 20). The save DC of this effect is equal to 15 + your Charisma modifier.

Established aristocrats consider your family crude, choosing to leave them on the margins of Taldan politics unless a noble thinks they could use you to curry favor with the Grand Prince, but hard-won practicality and newborn cynicism grant you insight most Taldan nobles lack. Once per day when rolling a Sense Motive check, you may roll two dice and use the better result.<br />´´´Zespire´´´: Your family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility.

A creature can halve this fire damage with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier).<br />You can use this feat's benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).

A creature successfully hit by an offensive blissful spell (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against an offensive blissful spell takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls for 1 round. A beneficial blissful spell instead grants affected creatures a +2 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for 1 round in addition to its normal effects. A blissful spell gains the good descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.<br />A blissful spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's normal spell level. Spells with the evil descriptor can't be blissful spells.|||||||||||19|161|26

You gain the ability associated with that domain from the ´´´invoke deity´´´ spell for a number of rounds equal to your number of channel energy dice. While this ability is active, taking actions directly opposed to your deity's teachings or alignment causes you to take the penalties listed in ´´´invoke deity´´´ and ends this effect. You can gain only one ability from this feat at a time, and its effects do not stack with ´´´invoke deity´´´.<br />If you instead expend two uses of channel energy, you can instead infuse a single willing target within 30 feet with deific essence.

A creature that dies within 1 round of being damaged by a crypt spell is considered to have been killed by a death effect for the purpose of being returned to life. An undead creature damaged by a crypt spell gains the sickened condition for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original spell level; this duration is halved if the undead creature succeeds at its saving throw against the spell. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can attempt a Will save to negate the sickened effect.

While this death field is in effect, small plants wither and recoil from you, allowing you to ignore the effects of difficult terrain caused by plant life and ignore the effects of spells like ´´´entangle´´´ that compel vegetation to grasp at you, provided the spell's level is 3rd or lower (the death field cannot affect more powerful plant magic).<br />Any swarm that enters your space takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage; this damage is applied before you are affected by any swarm attacks, so if the damage is enough to destroy the swarm, it does not harm you.<br />At the end of your turn each round the death field is active, you take 1 point of negative energy damage, and you cannot be healed by positive energy effects while the death field is in place. Magic items and spells that protect against negative energy damage do not protect against this damage, but if you are undead or have negative energy affinity (or a similar ability), the death field instead grants fast healing 1 while it is in effect.<br />You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).

3287|shadow's shroud|8|||||||||22:5|Shroud yourself in shadows to gain opportunity to attempt Stealth checks|You can camouflage yourself in shadows and gloom.|Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks|As a swift action, you can shroud yourself in shifting, camouflaging shadow. While shrouded in this fashion, you can attempt Stealth checks as though you had concealment, even in areas of normal or bright light. Creatures that can see normally in supernatural darkness can still see you normally.<br />You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.||||||Unlike spells like ´´´shadow walk´´´, which require you to be on a plane that is coterminous with the Shadow Plane, this feat functions even on planes that do not normally share a border with the Shadow Plane. Like all conduit feats, the effects are suppressed when planar travel is forbidden.|||||19|161|32
3288|stony rampart|6;8|||||||||22:3|Cause a low stone wall to spring up from the ground|Stone rises up at your command, offering cover to allies.|Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks|As a standard action, you can call forth a low wall of unworked stone along any side of a square within 30 feet. This wall is 5 feet long, 3 feet high, 2 inches thick, and acts as a low obstacle, except that it provides only partial cover. A single 5-foot section of stone created by this feat has hardness 8 and 30 hp. You can only have one such wall in existence at a time for every 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) you have (minimum 1); walls last for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes) before crumbling to dust. If you have 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (planes), you can create multiple walls as a single standard action by expending an equivalent number of uses of this ability.<br />You can use this feat's benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).|||||||||||19|161|32
3289|stygian spell|22||||||||||Water spell causes memory loss to target|Stygian spells forsake pure water for the memory-destroying tides of the River Styx.||You can enhance any spell with the water descriptor that targets at least one creature to become a Stygian spell. Any creature successfully hit by a Stygian spell (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against a Stygian spell must succeed at a Will save (using the save DC of the original spell) or suffer the fugue lesser madness in addition to the spell's normal effects. If the attack is a confirmed critical hit or the original saving throw result is a natural 1, the creature must instead succeed at a Will save (again using the same DC) or suffer the amnesia greater madness. Madness gained this way lasts indefinitely, but can be treated using the normal methods for curing madness. This is a mind-affecting effect, and creatures native to the River Styx are immune to it.<br />A spell modified by this feat gains the evil descriptor. A Stygian spell uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's normal spell level. Spells with the good descriptor can't be Stygian spells.|||||||||||19|161|32

When you set a new direction of gravity, you can reduce your falling speed by up to two-thirds (to a minimum of 50 feet on the first round and 100 feet per round thereafter) or increase it to a maximum of twice normal (300 feet on the first round and 600 feet per round thereafter).

While on such a plane, if your &quot;fall&quot; would cause you to collide with a creature or object, you can slam into it with devastating force as a standard action. You must succeed at a touch attack to slam a creature or object, with a cumulative -1 penalty for every 50 feet of your current falling speed; at the GM's discretion, you can automatically hit vast objects such as walls. A creature or object hit by this slam takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 50 feet of current falling speed, to a maximum of 6d6, and begins falling at your current speed according to your current subjective directional gravity.|||||||||||19|161|32

Your eidolon never refuses your call as a result of the differences between your respective alignments, though it still can refuse to follow commands that are against its ethos or alignment.<br />Each time you gain a summoner level, you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your eidolon's Hit Dice + your eidolon's Charisma modifier). On a failure, your alignment permanently shifts one step closer to that of your eidolon. Modifiers that are not permanent can't be applied on this saving throw.||||||If your alignment becomes the same as that of your eidolon, you can immediately replace this feat with any other feat you would have qualified for at 1st level.

This magically conjured water does not last long once it surges to enhance your speed, but its appearance can certainly astound those unaccustomed to such sights.|Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks|As a standard action, you can call forth a tide of water that flows around your feet and enhances your speed, as per ´´´slipstream´´´.<br />You can use this feat's benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).

A creature hit by a tumultuous spell (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against a tumultuous spell immediately moves 1d4&times;5 feet in a random direction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this movement would force a creature into a solid object or another creature, the movement ends harmlessly just before impact.<br />A tumultuous spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's normal spell level. Spells with the lawful descriptor can't be tumultuous spells.|||||||||||19|161|33

Those who you target with a pointed rebuke feel as if the disdain of Hell itself has turned its attention to their acts.|Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks|As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack. A creature successfully hit by this touch attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be staggered until the end of your next turn. If you use Tyrant's Rebuke on a creature that is already staggered by this effect and it fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage in addition to being staggered.<br />You can use this feat once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).|||||||||||19|161|33

You are practiced at turning the tables on armed foes and using their own weapons against them.|Catch Off-Guard; Improved Disarm|You take no penalty on your attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent while you are unarmed. If you succeed at a disarm attempt without using a weapon and choose to pick up the disarmed weapon, you can attack with that weapon as though you were proficient with it until the end of your next turn. If you are already proficient with that type of weapon, you gain a +2 morale bonus to your attack rolls with that weapon until the end of your next turn.|Attempting to disarm a foe while unarmed imposes a -4 penalty on the attack.||||||||||21|165|22

If you hit the target and deal damage, you can select either the root, sacral, or navel chakra, as long as you can open that chakra yourself. The target suffers a specific effect based on the chosen chakra (see below), though it can reduce these effects with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + the ability modifier you use to calculate your ki pool).<br />´´´Root´´´: The target's DR is reduced by 10 for 1 minute. If the target has multiple forms of DR, you choose which DR is reduced. On a successful save, the target's DR is instead reduced by 5 for 1 round.<br />´´´Sacral´´´: The target can't use any of its speeds except its land speed (or swim speed for an aquatic creature) for 1 round, and it moves at half speed for 1 minute. If it was flying, the target can attempt a Fly check to fall safely. On a successful save, the target instead moves at half speed for 1 round.<br />´´´Navel´´´: The target takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls, and it reduces the DCs of its spells and abilities by 2 for 1 minute. On a successful save, the penalty and reduction is halved and lasts for 1 round.|||||||||||21|165|28

This prevents hit point recovery from fast healing and regeneration but doesn't deactivate regeneration altogether, so it does not allow a creature with regeneration to be killed through hit point damage. On a successful save, the target recovers only half as many hit points for 1 round.<br />´´´Throat´´´: The target can't speak or cast spells with a thought component for 1 round, and for 1 minute, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 20% chance to fail. On a successful save, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 50% chance to fail for 1 round.<br />´´´Brow´´´: The target is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target loses all special forms of vision (such as low-light vision, see in darkness, and ´´´true seeing´´´) for 1 round; this doesn't affect nonvisual senses like blindsight and blindsense.<br />´´´Crown´´´: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on all d20 rolls for 1 round and on its first attack roll or caster level check each round for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target must roll twice and take the lower result on its next d20 roll.|||||||||||21|165|28

When your base attack bonus reaches +16, the target must also succeed at a Reflex save with a DC equal to 10 + your base attack bonus or become entangled.
