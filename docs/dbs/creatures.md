# Database Structure for *creatures/creatures.js*

## Fields

1. __Name__: Any sequence of letters, numbers, symbols and spaces, excluding | and the following reserved characters:
    * *%* is used for non-standard plural forms. (__Note__: constructing plural for solitary or unique creatures and mixed groups is not necessary)
        * Standard plural forms, handled automatically, are:
            1. Words ending in *s*, *x* and *ch* add *-es*. (e.g. *sphinx* becomes *sphinxes*)
            1. Words ending in *y* replace it with *-ies*. (e.g. *harpy* becomes *harpies*)
            1. Words ending with *man* replace it with *-men*. (e.g. *gillman* becomes *gillmen*)
            1. Everything else adds *-s*. (e.g. *ghost* becomes *ghosts*)
        * If the word has a non-standard ending, write *%-* followed by the ending (e.g. *monkey%-s*).
        * If the plural form is equal to the singular, just write *%-* (e.g. *drow%-*).
        * If the plural is not so simple to construct, write the whole plural form after *%* (e.g. *djinni%djinn*).
        * To summarize, substitutions and elimination of parts of text are not possible, the only operations permitted are concatenation and complete replacement of the text.
    * */* is used for alternative names. These names are shown in parentheses outside of the link (if enabled) and are not considered for plural. They are however inserted in the links. (e.g. *bearded devil/barbazu*)
    * *~* is used for alternative link names. While most pages are named following a standard, some are not, or maybe some creatures are just special cases of a generic monster. (e.g. *air mephit~mephit*)
        * The first letter after each space, open parenthesis and dash in a creature's name is automatically capitalized for the link generation, but that's not always how the page is named on AoN. If the link requires some special capitalization, use _~*_ instead. (e.g. _colour out of space~*Colour Out of Space_)
        * If the creature's sheet is not available on AoN, but can be found elsewhere, you can write the whole sheet's URL after *~*.
        * If the creature's sheet is not available anywhere on the web, you can force the creature to have no link by adding *~* followed by nothing else.
    * These special characters can be used in any combination, but have to be used in the order given above. (e.g. _lurker in light|lurkers in light~*Lurker in Light_)
    * Sometimes the apostrophe in a name has to be replaced with *%u2019* in the link. There's no rule for that, just check if it's a straight vertical apostrophe (no change needed) or if it's rounded. (e.g. _will-o'-wisp~*Will-o%u2019-Wisp_)
    * Names are usually all lower-case. The only exception are unique creatures, that should be capitalized appropriately, since the name is not the species' name but their proper name. (e.g. *Ragathiel*)
    * If you want the link to only include a part of the name, or you want multiple links in a single name (useful for mixed groups) enclose every part in square brackets. Inside them, all the rules listed above apply. (e.g. *a gang of 1 [dark stalker] and 1d4+1 [dark creepers~dark creeper]*)
        * If one of the creatures in the group has the mythic subtype, every link will point to the myhitc monster sheets. If this is not appropriate, add a *+* after the appropriate opened square bracket or *~*. (e.g. *a nest of 1 [tyrant jelly] plus 1d12+7 [giant wasps~+giant wasp]*)
        * It works the opposite way too, you can link to a mythic creature from a non-mythic entry using the *+* sign.
        * The *+* sign can be used together with the _*_, but the _*_ sign has to be first: _*+_.
    * HTML characters can be used in names. (e.g. _1d20 &amp;times; 10_ becomes _1d20 &times; 10_)
1. __Challenge rating__:
    * If CR is a whole number (1, 2, ...) just write it in this field.
    * If CR is fractional, use the following conversion: 1/2 = 0, 1/3 = -1, 1/4 = -2, 1/6 = -3, 1/8 = -4.
    * For mixed groups you need two values, separated by *;*. The first value is the CR of the creature with the highest CR in the group. The second is the (average) CR increase from this value. To know the total CR of a group (and thus the CR increase), you need to sum all the experience from the single creatures (look [here](https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Designing%20Encounters&Category=Building%20an%20Adventure) for the values). Where the number of creatures is defined by a dice roll, just multiply the experience points times the mean value of the dice roll. For a single die with *K* faces its mean value is *(K+1)/2* (if the number is not whole, use it as it is, it doesn't need to be whole) or, if you prefer a more general formula, for a *N*d*K*+*B* roll, the mean value is *N (K+1)/2 + B*. Then look on the same experience table linked above and find the two numbers between which you can put your value. If your value is closer to the smaller number, use that row as the CR, otherwise use the bigger number's row. __Example__: Consider a group of *1d4+1 gnolls and 1d2 dire hyenas*. Gnolls are CR 1, dire hyenas CR 3, so the first value in the CR field is 3. Then the total experience is 3.5 times the gnoll's experience (400 XP) plus 1.5 times the dire hyena's experience (800 XP). The total average experience from this encounter is 2600 XP. This value is between CR 6 (2400 XP) and 7 (3200 XP), and closer to CR 6, so this encounter has an average CR of 6. The CR increase, i.e. the second value to insert in the CR field, is then 6-3=3. This encounter will thus have a CR value of *3;3*.
1. __Mythic rank__: A number between 0 (non-mythic monster) and 10. If omitted, this value is considered 0. For mixed groups with more than one mythic creature, just insert the highest MR value of the group.
1. __Alignment__: One or more numbers separated by *;* to indicate all the possible alignments of a creature or group of creatures. A value of 0 indicates that any alignment is possible for this creature. <table><tr><td>LG: 1</td><td>NG: 2</td><td>CG: 3</td></tr><tr><td>LN: 4</td><td>N: 5</td><td>CN: 6</td></tr><tr><td>LE: 7</td><td>NE: 8</td><td>CE: 9</td></tr></table>

1. __Numerical Intervals__: One or more intervals, separated by *;* (mixed groups and unique creatures require only one interval, see below for details).
    * If a single number is used, it means that the creature can appear only in that amount. *0* indicates a creature that appears only in mixed groups. This creature will still appear in the simple list.
    * The interval is composed of two numbers separated by a *-* (e.g. *1-3*). The software will automatically fit all possible dice in this interval by itself.
    * Mixed groups are indicated with a _*_ __before__ the single number or interval. The number or interval have to specify how many creatures in total can be found in the group.
    * If the single number or interval is followed by a *u*, it means that the creature is unique, or that the group contains a unique creature. (Can be combined with _*_.)
    * If the single number or interval is followed by *%*, the text following indicates the name of a group composed of that amount of creatures. Can't be combined with *u*, nor with _*_.
1. __Variant Information__: If the creature is a variant of another creature, here is indicated the creature or creatures needed to construct this variant. The rules for the __Name__ apply here too.
1. __Source__: One or more numbers to indicate where the creature or creatures come from. <table><tr><td>Bestiary 1 (B1): 1</td><td>Bestiary 2 (B2): 2</td><td>Bestiary 3 (B3): 3</td></tr><tr><td>Bestiary 4 (B4): 4</td><td>Bestiary 5 (B5): 5</td><td>Bestiary 6 (B6): 6</td></tr><tr><td>Ultimate Magic (UM): 7</td><td>Mythic Adventures (MA): 8</td><td>Monster Codex (MC): 9</td></tr><tr><td>Horror Adventures (HA): 10</td><td>Book of the Damned (BD): 11</td><td>Ultimate Wilderness (UW): 12</td></tr><tr><td>Planar Adventures (PA): 13</td><td>Campaign Settings (CS): 14</td><td>Player Companions (PC): 15</td></tr><tr><td>Adventure Paths (AP): 16</td><td>Adventure Modules (AM): 17</td><td></td></tr></table>
