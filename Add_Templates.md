# Database Structure for *templates.js*

If you are interested in adding your templates to the database, here is how you can write them in.

__Warning__: The following values may change in future updates. I like to have everything in order, usually alphabetical based on the property's name, the numerical values should mirror that order, so whenever I add/move/remove some values (particularly subtypes and groups) I shift all the numbers appropriately. If you would like to add new values, remember to edit *random_encounters.html* too to add a checkbox in the appropriate place. Just copy and paste an existing checkbox and edit its value and ID (you should edit that number 3 times in total), as well as the property name.
