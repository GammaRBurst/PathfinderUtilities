# News about this project

Finally some news! I realized this little project deserves more care, so I'm reshaping it completely. In the last few months I learned a few new tricks with Git, so I may show some more activity with test branches in the future.

So what happened? Basically, I changed the project's name from RandomEncounterGeneratorPF to PathfinderUtilities. This is to take into account the fact that this project is evolving in a direction I couldn't imagine when I started it. Creating a highly filterable and customizable list of creatures inspired me to create a lot more along this line. This new, bigger project now includes a filterable feats list, and I'm currently working on a spell list.

I also added two Python3 programs that can be used more widely, not just for Pathfinder. The first is a dice roller. I programmed it to be able to roll almost any kind of dice. The second is a much simpler program, a battle grid generator.

For more on these additions, consult their [_doc_](docs/README.md) pages.

# About this project

PathfinderUtilites is basically a huge database that aims to contain all of Pathfinder's 1st Edition material produced by Paizo, together with some other utility programs that can actually have a much wider use.

The keywords that define this project are completeness and versatility. There is a lot of Pathfinder material on the internet, from many different sources, but I always found disappointing how difficult it is to find what I need in the huge amount of monsters, spells, feats, magic items and weapons that Paizo produced over the years. I felt the need to have a complete database of all the material. And by complete I don't just mean a list of names, I wanted it to include every single information, so that I, or anyone else, can search precisely for what I need.

So why did I decide to do this for an obsolete version of Pathfinder? Well, first of all, the first edition is still played by many people, so it's far from obsolete. And more importantly, when I started this project there was no mention of a second edition. There was just Pathfinder. But who knows, maybe I will create a second edition version of the database in the future as well...

# The future of this project

I'm planning many different databases and tools. I don't know how much time they will take me, but as long as I like working on them, I will. At the moment I'm working on a spell list, and I'm deciding the database structure and the possible values.

Other databases on my TODO list are classes and archetypes, races, magic items, mundane items (weapons, armor, special materials, and everything else), traits and drawbacks, perils (traps, haunts, ...) and deities. This list is not definitive though, I will probably add or remove some elements in the future.

I'm also working on some other software based on Python3, namely a starry sky generator for the maniacally thorough workbuilders, and a random name generator that produces words that sound like known languages. These projects will progress at a much slower rate though.
